5,umich-scl-hayden,Enemy,2,bioghist,"Thomas Emmett Hayden (Tom Hayden) was born on December 11, 1939 in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Dondero High School in 1956 and went onto attend the University of Michigan, where he served as the editor of the Michigan Daily. While a student at the University of Michigan, Hayden became one of the founders of the leftist student organization, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), playing an active role in drafting the group's manifesto called the Port Huron Statement, which sought to create a ""radically new democratic political movement"" in the United States that rejected hierarchy and bureaucracy. He served as President of SDS from 1962-1963. In 1968, Hayden along with seven other demonstrators, referred to as the ""Chicago Eight"" had integral parts in orchestrating protests outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois and were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot that were later dropped on appeal. Hayden is also known for making several trips to North Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War, especially the 1972 trip he made with his future wife, Jane Fonda, whom he married the following year. The couple's son Troy was born on July 7, 1973. Haden and Fonda were instrumental in the production of the documentary, Introduction to the Enemy, which chronicled their travels through North and South Vietnam in the spring of 1974. During this period, Hayden also spearheaded the Indochina Peace Campaign that mobilized dissent against the Vietnam War and demanded unconditional amnesty for draft dodgers. Fonda turned the moniker into the name of her film company that produced movies like F.T.A. and Introduction to the Enemy.,  Hayden entered the political arena in 1976 when he ran for the primary to be a U.S. Senator from California. Despite conducting a spirited campaign, Hayden came in second. He and Fonda then initiated the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which promoted solar energy, environmental protection, and renter rights' policies as well as candidates for local offices. Hayden represented the 44th district in the California State Assembly from 1982 to 1990. He won a seat in the California State Senate in 1992. Though he lost in the Democratic primary for the California gubernatorial race in 1994, Hayden was able to keep his seat in the Senate in the 1996 election. In 1997, he decided to run for mayor of Los Angeles, which he ultimately lost. Hayden thought about entering the race in 2000 to represent the 42nd district in the California State Assembly but reconsidered to campaign to be part of the Los Angeles City Council,which was a battle he ended up losing. He did, however, become the state's first energy official. Throughout his political career, Hayden has strove to make an impact. He has been a champion of many issues from disaster assistance, to safe driving, to Holocaust reparations, to tobacco regulation, to HIV/AIDS programs. Hayden was on the forefront of proposing educational and environmental initiatives, which were two main focuses of his as a legislator. He also contended with matters that emerged while in office like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority strikes that occurred in the 1990s. While Hayden was primarily concerned with problems facing the Californian population, he also showed an interest in global events, particularly in the Israel, Ireland, and El Salvador conflicts.,  In addition to his roles as an activist and politician, Hayden has also written profusely. Some of his books include: Vietnam: The Struggle for Peace, 1972-1973 (1973), The American Future: New Visions beyond Old Frontiers (1980) , Reunion: A Memoir (1988), The Lost Gospel of Earth: A Call for Renewing Nature, Spirit and Politics (1996), Irish Hunger (1997), and Irish on the Inside: A Search of the Soul of Irish America (2001), and Street Wars: Gangs and the Future of Violence (2004). He has also written numerous articles about a host of topics that range from baseball to the Iraq War.,  Another capacity in which Hayen has served has been as an instructor. He has taught numerous courses on social movements at Pitzer College, Scripps College, Occidental College, Harvard University's Institute for Politics, and University of California Los Angeles.,  In recognition for his contributions to society at large, Hayden has been awarded numerous honors such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Martin Luther King Legacy Association President's Award, Irish American Unity Conference Sean MacBride Award in 1997, and The State Senate Peace Keepers Award in 1998."
6,umich-scl-welsh,Native,1,bioghist,"Herbert Welsh (1851-1941) was a political reformer and indigenous peoples rights' activist in United States. Welsh was born in Pennsylvania, the youngest of 8 children. Before becoming involved in politics, Welsh spent his early life immersed in the study of art with the intention of working as an artist. After a time, he became involved in humanitarian causes and rights reform. In 1882, he founded the Indian Rights Association, which was a group of white Pennsylvanians working on behalf of American indigenous peoples. In 1890, he became involved in the fight against political corruption by joining the Civil Service Reform Association of Pennsylvania as well as the National Civil Service Reform League. During his career, he also authored a number of publications discussing the rights of Native Americans with a particular majority concerning the Great Sioux Nation. In addition to addressing political corruption and human rights in America, Welsh also had a keen interest in anti-imperialism. He vocally disavowed the United States' involvement in the Spanish American War as well as the country's involvement in the Philippines."
