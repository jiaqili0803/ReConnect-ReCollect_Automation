Prior to the Museum of Anthropology's establishment in 1922, the earliest archaeological acquisitions came to the University Museum from the Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific from 1838 to 1842. Other significant collections were acquired by Joseph Beal Steere during his many trips to the Amazon, the Andes, the south Pacific and Southeast Asia in the 1870s through the 1890s. His expeditions to the Philippines began a long and continuing tradition of research in that area. Steere was also in charge of the university's natural history collections from 1876 to 1894.,  In 1922, Dean C. Worcester, one-time curator of the zoological museum at the university, returned to Ann Arbor from the Philippines to obtain support for an archaeological expedition to investigate Philippine cave sites with Chinese porcelains. Professors Francis Kelsey and Alexander G. Ruthven lent their support and requested that Carl Eugen Guthe lead the expedition with funds contributed anonymously by Horace H. Rackham. Guthe agreed to lead the party, but only if a separate Museum of Anthropology were established to house the material collected.,  Guthe's request was granted; in 1922 the University Museums were reorganized and the Museum of Anthropology was formally recognized. Carl Guthe was made the Associate Director of Anthropology in the University Museum. The collection of porcelains Guthe obtained during the three years of the Philippines expedition became the museum's most valuable single collection. Wilbert Hinsdale, formerly dean of the School of Homeopathy, was made custodian in charge of the Collections in Michigan Archaeology. Guthe's collections were housed in the basement of Angell Hall from 1925 to 1927, while Hinsdale's were located in the Museum Building.,  In 1928, the Museum of Anthropology moved into the fourth floor of the just completed University Museums Building. The museum consisted of five rooms for collections, seven rooms for offices, a library, and an office. In 1929, Guthe was promoted to director of the museum. One of Guthe's many acts as director was to offer a doctoral fellowship in Aboriginal North American Ceramics to James B. Griffin. Griffin began the fellowship in 1933, completed his degree in 1936, then joined the museum staff. In late 1943 Guthe resigned as director of the museum and recommended that Griffin be appointed as his successor. Administrative conflicts stalled the appointment for several years, but Griffin was finally approved by the Regents as the museum's director in 1946. He held this position until his retirement in 1975.,  Upon its establishment, the museum had been arranged into five collection-oriented divisions (also referred to as ranges): the Division of the Great Lakes, the Division of the Orient, the Division of Archaeology, the Division of Ethnology, and the Division of Physical Anthropology. The Division of the Great Lakes dealt with the anthropological resources of the state of Michigan and the areas of other states and Canada that border on the Great Lakes. After Hinsdale died in 1944, Emerson F. Greenman took charge of the Great Lakes Division until 1966.,  The Division of the Orient was devoted to collections from Asia and the Far East. Benjamin March was the division's first curator, followed by Kamer Aga-Oglu. The Division of Archaeology was established for the study of archaeological collections around the world, with particular focus on North America. The Ceramic Repository of the Eastern United States, a central sherd repository for prehistoric ceramic materials from the region east of the Rocky Mountains and north of the Gulf of Mexico, was founded within this division in 1927. James Griffin served as curator of the division until he became director, and was succeeded by Albert Spaulding.,  The Division of Ethnology was established to house ethnological specimens from around the world, with particular focus on North America. Its first curator was Melvin Gilmore, followed by Volney Jones. The Ethnobotanical Laboratory, a center for the identification and interpretation of plant materials utilized by Native Americans, was established within this division in 1938. The Division of Physical Anthropology was originally not provided with a curator and was essentially inactive until 1966, when C. Loring Brace was appointed as curator. From that point on, the division focused primarily on prehistoric skeletal collections from North America.,  The Museum of Anthropology achieved substantial growth during Griffin's long tenure as director. The staff grew from four professional curators to nine, along with additional research associates and assistants. The museum partnered with the Department of Physics in the administration of the Radiocarbon Laboratory from 1949 to 1970; the lab was the second of its kind in the United States. Field programs were greatly expanded, with significant work done in Michigan, the Mississippi Valley, the Southwest, Western and Eastern Europe, and Israel. The museum also took an active role in the university's Department of Anthropology; the museum served as a training ground for most graduate students in archaeology and all curators held academic year appointments in the department, teaching courses and advising numerous doctoral students. Griffin served as chair of the department from 1972 to 1975.,  After Griffin's retirement, Richard I. Ford, Curator of Ethnology, was appointed as director, serving until 1981. From that period to the present, the museum's directorship has rotated among the curators of the museum, who generally serve three- or five-year terms., In February 2014, the Museum was renamed the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology., The geographic focus of the collections has expanded, with additional curatorial positions provided for materials from Europe, Africa and Mesopotamia. The current ranges include Great Lakes Archaeology, North American Archaeology, Asian Archaeology, Ethnology, Physical Anthropology, New World High Civilizations and Old World High Civilizations. The museum currently has twelve curators, in addition to other professional and support staff.,  Today, the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology is one of the major research facilities in the United States for the collection and study of archaeological and ethnological materials.,  (A published history of the museum may be found in The University of Michigan, An Encyclopedic Survey.

4,umich-bhl-2011132,Igorot,7,bioghist,"Richard Schneidewind was a native and resident of Detroit, Mich. and veteran of the Spanish-American War (1898). Schneidewind joined the U.S. Army in 1898 as a nurse in the Field Hospital Corps. In the Philippines he was made the head nurse and treated men ill with typhoid and spinal meningitis. After contracting typhoid and not completely recovered, he was sent to Corregidor Island where his unit was building a convalescent hospital. Still a patient, Schneidewind was given light duties. He remained on the sick list until his discharge from the service in July 1899.,  After his discharge Schneidewind stayed in the Philippines and married Gabina Dionicio R. y Gabriel in 1900. Gabina died in 1901 giving birth to their son Richard, who later became Professor of Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Michigan.,  After Gabina's death Schneidewind returned to the U.S. In 1904 he worked at the St. Louis World's Fair where, among similar exhibits, he saw the ""Igorot Village"" exhibit that included 123 Igorots brought by the Dr. Truman K. Hunt's Igorot Exhibit Company.,  By 1905 Schneidewind with his partner Edmund A. Felder formed the Filipino Exhibition Company. Schneidewind met Felder in 1904 when Felder was the Executive Officer of the Philippine Exposition Board at the St. Louis World's Fair. In 1905 they arranged a group of Igorot men and women from the Luzon mountain interior to be brought for a tour.,  In 1906 Schneidewind married Selma Echholz. In 1907 he brought to the U.S. 40 Igorot people; 40 people in 1908; and in 1911 his company brought 55 people on a tour of Europe (France, England, and Belgium). Some people went on more than one journey.,  Toward the end of the 1911 European tour the Schneidewind's company experienced serious financial problems. In winter 1913 American newspapers reported about starving Igorots wandering the streets of Ghent, Belgium. The U.S. government intervened, and in December 1913 the newspapers reported that all of the Igorots were sent back to the Philippines. In 1914 U.S. government put an end to exhibitions of Filipinos.,  In 1915 Schneidewind managed exhibits of people from Samoa at fairs in California. In the 1920s Schneidewind settled in Detroit. He died in January 1949."

8,umich-bhl-2012140,Native,2,bioghist,"The University of Michigan Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS), was founded in 1970 as Center for Afroamerican and African Studies (CAAS) to be a home for interdisciplinary research, teaching and community outreach. In 2011, CAAS became the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) in the College of Literature Science and the Arts (LSA).,  CAAS's beginnings are rooted in the era of the modern civil rights and black consciousness movements of the 1960s. Beginning in 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King, black students commandeered several campus buildings and demanded talks with new University President Robben Fleming. In addition to discussing the overall atmosphere on campus for black students, the activists voiced the first public call for a program in Black studies. A committee was charged by Rackham Dean Stephen H. Spurr to explore the possibility of creating an African-American studies program. Interest in such a program increased in 1970, when participants in the first Black Action Movement (BAM) on campus called for the establishment of a ""Center for Afro-American Studies"" to be based on a proposal written by J. Frank Yates, Assistant to the Dean of LSA.,  When the Regents established the center in the summer of 1970, its scope was broadened to include African studies, on the expectation that, ""the study of Africa, Afroamerica, and the Caribbean within a single intellectual framework was not only defensible but represented the future direction of Black Studies."" This ""diasporic perspective"" has defined the framework for study and teaching conducted by the center's faculty. The center was to offer an interdisciplinary curriculum taught by an international faculty and had a first-year enrollment of 1,026 students. Over the next two years the center acquired a ""Writer in Residence"" program and a visiting faculty program. CAAS faculty and students envisioned a commitment to both the University and the local and regional Black communities and over the next few years, center participants worked to find the right balance between these activities.,  The Ford Foundation granted CAAS funds for the project ""From Margin to Center: Towards a New Black Scholarship,"" beginning in 1988 and additional funds for its pilot project ""Strengthening African Studies."" The program provided: a small seed grant program to foster collaborative research on Africa; helped fund a Summer Institute on Social Science Methods and African Studies; and an Africa Theme Semester.,  During its forty-year span CAAS has played host to a number of notable events and programs, including an ongoing colloquium series, the Dubois-Mandela-Rodney Fellowship Program (since 1988), and two conferences in memory of the noted poet and essayist Robert Hayden in 1980 and 1990. The center has also sponsored study abroad programs in Barbados, Jamaica, Ghana and South Africa. Since 2000, CAAS has also been the home of the South African Initiatives Office (SAIO).,  Originally, the Center sponsored an undergraduate concentration. An undergraduate minor was added in 2000 and a graduate certificate program began in 2005. First housed on Monroe Street, CAAS moved to West Hall and then to its current home in Haven Hall. Facilities have included a professionally staffed library and archives and an art gallery.,  The Lemuel A. Johnson Library at CAAS supported the curriculum by collecting and organizing archival materials related to black faculty, staff and student organizations, student activism, and national and international events relevant social justice. These files, now transferred to the Bentley, were publicly available for research and consultation. They included records relating to the BAM movements as well as several other university organizations, whose records were transferred together with the CAAS organizational archives. Brief profiles of those documented organizations follow.,  The Black Action Movement (BAM) was formed in 1970 from a coalition of the Black Student Union, the Black Law Students Association, the Association of Black Social Work Students, and groups of black students from the Medical School and the Psychology Department. They presented a list of demands to then University President, Robben Flemming. One of those demands, was, in fact the establishment of CAAS. There were two subsequent BAM episodes, BAM II (1974-5) and BAM III in 1985-7.,  The United Coalition Against Racism (UCAR) formed in the Spring of 1987 in response to a series of racist incidents on campus, including racist jokes aired on a campus radio station and a racist flyer pushed under the door of black women studying in a dormitory lounge. UCAR engaged in action aimed at U-M administrators, putting forth demands for institutional changes and convening mass protests in response to racist incidents. In addition it presented teach-ins and speakers. Originally funded by the Office of Minority Affairs (created in response to an original UCAR demand) for specific projects, other funds were provided by the organization's own fundraising and the Michigan Student Assembly.,  UCAR also founded the Ella Baker-Nelson Mandela Center for Anti-Racist Education, or the Baker-Mandela Center (BMC) during the summer of 1988. Its purpose was to collect and generate literature, provide a speakers bureau, and to serve as a gathering place for anti-racist activists. The overall objectives were to promote anti-racist consciousness and to promote anti-racist student leaders, particularly within Third World communities; to heighten the level of discussion and research on various aspects of race, class and gender issues and to provide concrete tools to anti-racist organizers to help refute stereotypes and myths, and challenge apathy or cynicism. It was housed in the East Engineering Building. Barbara Ransby and Tracye Matthews were important leaders in the organization of the center.,  The University of Michigan Free South Africa Coordinating Committee (FSACC) was a diverse campus-based group of faculty and students opposed to the Apartheid system in South Africa, founded in the Spring of 1985. The group's aims included producing literature, sponsoring events and pressuring institutions to sever economic ties with corporations doing business in South Africa. FSACC records concern activism during the 1980s and early 1990s, especially the construction of an ""anti-apartheid shanty"" on the University of Michigan Diag and a petition to grant Nelson Mandela an honorary degree.,  The Students of Color Coalition (SCC), another campus-based group, formed to protest the mocking use of Native American names, images and regalia by a semi-secret student honor society called Michigamua. In early 2000, SCC members occupied the Michigamua offices in the tower of the Michigan Union for thirty-seven days. As a result of the controversy, Michigamua agreed to stop using Native American practices, and in 2006 adopted a new name, ""The Order of Angell."", ------------------,  1.

19,umich-bhl-851733,Colonial,1,bioghist,"Harry Burns Hutchins was born near Lisbon, New Hampshire, on April 8,1847 and received his preparatory education in the east. However, from the time he entered the University of Michigan as an undergraduate, his life and work were closely tied to Michigan. As a student, Hutchins was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and an editor of the University Chronicle. He was the first student to receive a degree from James B. Angell in 1871, and upon graduation worked for a year as superintendent of the Owosso schools. Hutchins returned to the university as an instructor in rhetoric and history and became an assistant professor a year later. During the three years he held that post, he studied law and began practicing law in Mount Clemens in 1876. , On December 27, 1872, Harry B. Hutchins married Marry Louise Crocker, of Birmingham, Michigan. Mary was born on January 14, 1857, the daughter of Fandira Emery Crocker and Thomas Martin Crocker. She was a descendent of Thomas Hooker, founder of Hartford, Connecticut, and Deacon William Crocker, one of the early settlers of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Mrs. Hutchins graduated from Mt. Clemens High School in 1869. , In 1884, Mr. Hutchins returned to the University of Michigan as Jay Professor of Law. His teaching and organizational skills were recognized by Cornell University which invited him to organize its law school in 1887. He later returned to Ann Arbor and was appointed dean of the University of Michigan's Department of Law in 1895. He served as interim president of the university in 1897-98 while President Angell was serving as envoy to Turkey, and again in 1909-10 after Angell's resignation. In spite of Hutchins reluctance to accept the appointment as president at age 63, the Regents prevailed upon him, and he agreed to serve for five years. Letters of July 5, 1910, to Regents Leland and Knappen (box 2, folder 1) detail the conditions of his acceptance; numerous letters in the next few months replying to congratulatory messages he received, reiterate his doubts and hesitation. However, once in office he applied himself to the job with diligence. Hutchins believed that the university should be a leader and a contributor to the public good. Toward that end, he travelled extensively in his first year in office lecturing and meeting with alumni to encourage their support of the university by establishing active regional alumni organizations. He also oversaw the beginnings of an extension service to better serve the people of the Michigan. At first only a kind of speakers' bureau, which arranged for university professors to lecture to various groups outstate, it later added courses in outlying localities for which university credit could be earned., President Hutchins took a personal interest in students, often inviting them to call on him, but he was also a strict disciplinarian who held students to a high standard of academic work and personal morality. His term in office was extended beyond five years by the demands of World War I, and he served until 1920., Mr. and Mrs. Hutchins hosted many friends and distinguished guests, including U.S. President William H. Taft, to their home in Ann Arbor and their summer cottage in Cotuit, Massachusetts. Mary Hutchins was a member of many organizations including the Daughters of the American Revolution, a Regent of the Sarah Caswell Angell Chapter, the National Committee for the American flag, the Michigan Chapter of Colonial Dames, the American Association of University Women (Ann Arbor branch), the Faculty Women's Club, and a founding member of the Ann Arbor Women's Club. Mary Hutchins died of a heart attack on August 2, 1927. , After his retirement in 1920, Hutchins became President Emeritus and continued to serve the university in various capacities until his death. Harry B. Hutchins died on January 25, 1930."

37,umich-bhl-85899,Hygiene,1,bioghist,"Marion Le Roy Burton grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to which his family had moved from Brooklyn, Iowa, soon after his birth on August 30, 1874. Although he had to go to work after only one year of high school, he later completed his preparation at Carleton Academy, and graduated from Carleton College in 1900. He married Nina Moses the same year. Burton earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Yale in 1906, and a Ph.D. in 1907. After teaching theology at Yale and serving as pastor of a church for several years, Burton was elected president of Smith College, where he remained until he became president of the University of Minnesota in 1910. In the spring of 1920 he was chosen to become the sixth president of the University of Michigan, and served from September 1920 until his death in February 1925.,  President Burton was known for his warm personality, organizational ability, and the power of his oratory, which was used to good effect to convince the Michigan Legislature of the university's great need for new buildings and increased funding for educational programs. He lent his talents to the national political scene when he gave the speech nominating Calvin Coolidge as the Republican Party's presidential candidate in 1924. Respected and well-liked by his colleagues, he worked tirelessly to carry out his broad vision of education. During his regrettably short tenure, he laid a solid foundation for the growth of the university, both academically and physically, between the two world wars.,   University of Michigan history during the Burton presidency,  When Marion L. Burton became president in October 1920, he immediately faced the need to accommodate a greatly increased student population through the expansion of departments, and the addition of new subject areas. The pressing need for more physical space resulted in an extensive building program, and the changing academic needs led to departmental additions and re-organizations. This rapid expansion of the university following World War I also necessitated various administrative changes.,  The most visible accomplishment of the Burton Administration was the expansion of the physical facilities of the campus. Following a campus-wide survey of needs, President Burton and the regents devoted their energies and attention to securing a multi-million dollar appropriation from the state legislature. When this was successfully accomplished, a comprehensive building program was adopted. With regental approval, it was put under the jurisdiction of the Committee of Five, consisting of the president and secretary of the university, Regent William L. Clements, Albert Kahn, consulting architect of the project, and Psychology Professor John F. Shepard, who acted as supervisor of plans. In June 1921, the regents decided to start the program with an addition to the Dental Clinic, completion of the University Hospital, and the construction of East Engineering, East Physics, and University High School buildings. In addition, generous private donations provided for the building of Clements Library, and the Lawyers' Club group. President Burton's untimely death in February 1925 denied him the opportunity to see all these plans completed.,  Perhaps the most vexing question of the many problems faced by President Burton in the early years of his tenure was that of the Homeopathic Medical School and Hospital. The action of the state legislature in cutting off funding for a separate school and hospital drew the attention of homeopathic doctors in the state and nation resulting in a blizzard of letters and editorials protesting any move to change the school or hospital. Nevertheless the unit was disbanded in 1921-22, when homeopathic teaching and medical care were incorporated into the University Medical School and Hospital.,  This was also a period of turbulence and re-organization in the Medical School and Hospital apart from the issues raised by the closing of the Homeopathic School and Hospital. Some major issues were whether faculty should be ""full-time"" or allowed to treat and receive fees from outside patients; the obligation of the hospital to treat indigent patients; the administrative relationship of the Hospital to the Medical School; the need for a separate Nursing School; and whether the Hospital should be self-supporting or funded by the Medical School since patients were used for teaching.,  The period 1920-25 saw the establishment of a number of academic units as separate schools, and changes and additions to the curriculum of others. The School of Education was established by the Board of Regents in May 1921, and Allen S. Whitney, who had held the chair of Pedagogy in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, was appointed dean. Under his leadership a university high school and an elementary school were established in 1922 and 1927 respectively, to meet the needs of the practical aspects of teacher training. A growing public awareness of the desirability of teaching health and hygiene in the public schools led to the development of the Department of Physical Education in the School of Education. In 1923-24, Dr. Margaret Bell became Associate Professor of Women's Physical Education but this work was felt to be more appropriate under the University Health Service. In further recognition of its public health obligations, the university organized a Division of Hygiene and Public Health in 1921. In the beginning this encompassed work in public health, physical education, intramural sports, and was closely related to the University Health Service. Eventually, these areas were divided into separate units.,  President Burton's belief that a creative artist on campus would be an inspiration to the whole university community, persuaded the regents to raise funds and authorize a Fellowship in Creative Art. Former Governor Chase S. Osborn donated funds for the first year, and Robert Frost accepted the fellowship for 1921-22. He was also on campus for the better part of following year.,  Social workers throughout the state wanted better training for their profession and their efforts led to the development of a curriculum in social work in May 1921. The Department of Industrial Research became the Department of Engineering Research in October 1920 and included the Industrial Research Laboratory which undertook research projects for Michigan's growing manufacturing industries.,  Although not formally established until 1926, plans were under way to set up a Department of Library Science. Considerable attention was given to separating the study of architecture from the School of Engineering and to incorporating an already existing correlated School of Music into the university, but neither was actually accomplished during President Burton's tenure.,  Soon after taking office, President Burton re-organized the committee structure of the Board of Regents from a system of each regent overseeing one college or school to that of committees concerned with overall functions of the university, such as Educational Policies, Student Welfare, Finance, Buildings & Grounds. Regent Lucius L. Hubbard was engaged in re-writing the university by-laws. The staffing of the president's office was enlarged, and a presidential assistant, Professor Frank Robbins, was added. The establishment of new units required the development of appropriate management plans, while older units saw shifts in their governance, such as the change in jurisdiction of the Nichols Arboretum from the Department of Botany to the Board of Regents.,  During his first year, President Burton established the office of Dean of Students and appointed Joseph A. Bursley to handle matters previously dealt with directly by the president or by various committees. The Dean of Students took over the Employment Bureau (previously run by the Student Christian Association), as well as the Student Loan Fund.,  Under President Burton the old system of departmental governance by a permanent head appointed by the administration was changed to one of chairpersons elected for a limited term and committees set up by the department. This system was started in the English Department in 1920, the Economics Department in 1921, and the Mathematics Department in 1922.,  The problem of student discipline which arose with the increased student population required the attention of the administration for some time, and work was started on a uniform code of student discipline, although it was not until later that the code was adopted.,  Various other issues received attention during President's Burton's tenure. Among the more important were the adoption of a system of retirement pay. For a number of years the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching had been providing ""retirement allowances"" to a limited number of professors. As this became inadequate to meet the needs of growing educational institutions, the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association was established, and university policies were adapted to the new system. This was also a period when renewed attention was given to the needs and interests of women students, including suitable housing and appropriate curriculum. In addition, the Student Christian Association was in need of re-vitalizing after a decline during the war years."

56,umich-bhl-89211,Hygiene,1,bioghist,"Myron Wegman, Dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health from 1960 to 1974 and Professor of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases in the Medical School was born on July 23, 1908 in Brooklyn, New York. He was educated at the City College of New York (BA 1928), Yale University (MD 1932), and Johns Hopkins University (MPH, 1938).,  His career began in 1936 with the Maryland State Health Department, Bureau of Child Hygiene. He spent a year, 1941-1942, at the School of Tropical Health in San Juan, Puerto Rico and then worked at the New York City Health Department while teaching part time at Johns Hopkins University, Columbia, and Cornell. In 1946 he took the position of professor and head of Pediatrics for Louisiana State University Medical School. From 1952 to 1960, Wegman held several positions in the World Health Organization (WHO), including chief of education and training, secretary-general, and consultant to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).,  When Wegman became Dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health in 1960, he was a well-established figure in the field of public health and a respected specialist in child health care. Wegman's work reflects a concern for the best possible health care for the greatest number of people, a position which was cause for worry for many administrators and medical care professionals because it implied a substantial financial commitment and institutional restructuring. While at the University of Michigan, Wegman served on the Commission on the Reduction of Excess Hospital Capacity. Here he was given the difficult task of targeting hospitals for bed reduction. Dr. Wegman also headed the push to implement HMOs at the university, a proposal vigorously resisted by administrators.,  Dr. Wegman served on numerous committees and boards, often assisting with project implementation. He was one of the developers of Project HEADSTART. He helped to develop three health planning organizations; he was President of the Comprehensive Health Planning Council of Southeastern Michigan and member of the Michigan State Public Health Advisory Council. He was active in the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Board of Preventative Medicine, and the American Medical Association among other health organizations. His annual reports on world infant mortality in the journal Pediatrics from 1950 to 1997, gave him international repute as an authority on child health.,  Among the many honors he received during his career were: the Sedgwick Medal, the highest award of the American Public Health Association, Man of the Year from the City College of New York, the Clifford G. Grulee Medal from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Bronfman Prize from the American Public Health Association. On his eightieth birthday, the Myron E. Wegman Endowed Scholarship Fund was begun in tribute to his many professional accomplishments.,  In retirement with emeritus status, Wegman pursued many professional activities as a consultant, public speaker, and advisor. In 1990 he was coordinator for the university's collaboration with the Autonomous University of Madrid. He died April 12, 2004."
