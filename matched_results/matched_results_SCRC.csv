He graduated from Dondero High School in 1956 and went onto attend the University of Michigan, where he served as the editor of the Michigan Daily. While a student at the University of Michigan, Hayden became one of the founders of the leftist student organization, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), playing an active role in drafting the group's manifesto called the Port Huron Statement, which sought to create a ""radically new democratic political movement"" in the United States that rejected hierarchy and bureaucracy. He served as President of SDS from 1962-1963. In 1968, Hayden along with seven other demonstrators, referred to as the ""Chicago Eight"" had integral parts in orchestrating protests outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois and were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot that were later dropped on appeal. Hayden is also known for making several trips to North Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War, especially the 1972 trip he made with his future wife, Jane Fonda, whom he married the following year. The couple's son Troy was born on July 7, 1973. Haden and Fonda were instrumental in the production of the documentary, Introduction to the Enemy, which chronicled their travels through North and South Vietnam in the spring of 1974. During this period, Hayden also spearheaded the Indochina Peace Campaign that mobilized dissent against the Vietnam War and demanded unconditional amnesty for draft dodgers. Fonda turned the moniker into the name of her film company that produced movies like F.T.A. and Introduction to the Enemy.;  Hayden entered the political arena in 1976 when he ran for the primary to be a U.S. Senator from California. Despite conducting a spirited campaign, Hayden came in second. He and Fonda then initiated the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which promoted solar energy, environmental protection, and renter rights' policies as well as candidates for local offices. Hayden represented the 44th district in the California State Assembly from 1982 to 1990. He won a seat in the California State Senate in 1992. Though he lost in the Democratic primary for the California gubernatorial race in 1994, Hayden was able to keep his seat in the Senate in the 1996 election. In 1997, he decided to run for mayor of Los Angeles, which he ultimately lost. Hayden thought about entering the race in 2000 to represent the 42nd district in the California State Assembly but reconsidered to campaign to be part of the Los Angeles City Council,which was a battle he ended up losing. He did, however, become the state's first energy official. Throughout his political career, Hayden has strove to make an impact. He has been a champion of many issues from disaster assistance, to safe driving, to Holocaust reparations, to tobacco regulation, to HIV/AIDS programs. Hayden was on the forefront of proposing educational and environmental initiatives, which were two main focuses of his as a legislator. He also contended with matters that emerged while in office like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority strikes that occurred in the 1990s. While Hayden was primarily concerned with problems facing the Californian population, he also showed an interest in global events, particularly in the Israel, Ireland, and El Salvador conflicts.;  In addition to his roles as an activist and politician, Hayden has also written profusely. Some of his books include: Vietnam: The Struggle for Peace, 1972-1973 (1973), The American Future: New Visions beyond Old Frontiers (1980) , Reunion: A Memoir (1988), The Lost Gospel of Earth: A Call for Renewing Nature, Spirit and Politics (1996), Irish Hunger (1997), and Irish on the Inside: A Search of the Soul of Irish America (2001), and Street Wars: Gangs and the Future of Violence (2004). He has also written numerous articles about a host of topics that range from baseball to the Iraq War.;  Another capacity in which Hayen has served has been as an instructor. He has taught numerous courses on social movements at Pitzer College, Scripps College, Occidental College, Harvard University's Institute for Politics, and University of California Los Angeles.;  In recognition for his contributions to society at large, Hayden has been awarded numerous honors such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Martin Luther King Legacy Association President's Award, Irish American Unity Conference Sean MacBride Award in 1997, and The State Senate Peace Keepers Award in 1998."

17,umich-scl-sayles,sayles_20221006_151935_UTC__ead,John Sayles Papers,Dead,1,bioghist,"John Sayles, in full John Thomas Sayles (born Sept. 28, 1950, Schenectady, N.Y., U.S.), American motion-picture director, screenwriter, novelist, and actor who since the 1980s has been among the most prominent independent filmmakers in the United States. Parlaying his fees as a screenwriter of mainstream Hollywood films into funding for his own ambitious filmmaking projects, Sayles created an oeuvre in which the personal and the political intersect at the heart of the American experience.;  The child of educators, Sayles earned a B.A. in psychology from Williams College (1972), where he also acted in plays and began writing fiction. After graduation Sayles supported himself with a variety of blue-collar jobs that broadened his worldview, as did a number of cross-country hitchhiking sojourns. In 1975 he published his first novel, The Pride of the Bimbos, about a cross-dressing barnstorming softball team. A year later he won an O. Henry Award for his short story ""I-80 Nebraska, m.490–m.205,"" and he earned another in 1977 for ""Breed."" Sayles's second novel, Union Dues (1977), which follows a West Virginia miner's search for his son against the backdrop of the tumultuous 1960s, was a finalist for a National Book Award. His short stories from the period were collected in The Anarchist's Convention (1979).;  Sayles wrote his way into the motion-picture industry, using as his calling card a screenplay based on the Black Sox Scandal, which he would eventually direct as Eight Men Out (1988). His early screenwriting efforts—several of which were written for Roger Corman, including Piranha (1978) and Battle Beyond the Stars (1980)—were genre exercises that Sayles loaded with literary and cinematic references. Later for-hire screenwriting projects included The Howling (1981), The Quick and the Dead (1995), and The Alamo (2004). With a paltry $40,000 earned from his writing, Sayles made his directorial debut with Return of the Secaucus 7 (1980), which chronicled the reunion of former college friends who had been activists in the 1960s. The cast, made up primarily of actors with whom Sayles had worked in summer-stock theatre, included his Williams College classmates David Strathairn and Maggie Renzi, who became Sayles's life partner and the producer of most of his films.;  With Return, Sayles began a body of work that proved him to be the heir to the patient, character-driven tradition of independent filmmaking pioneered by John Cassavetes. Sayles's politically aware films often focus on marginalized characters, weave together various strata of society, or examine unfamiliar chapters of U.S. history. Frequently they reveal a failure of American life to deliver on the promise of its national ideals, yet they are almost always leavened with humour and grounded in hope. In addition to writing, directing, and often acting in his films, Sayles also usually edited them himself.;  Wallenfeldt, Jeff. ""John Sayles."" http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Sayles. Retrieved 09-21-2015.;  John Sayles and Maggie Renzi have been creative partners, in their life and in their art, since the early '70s. They met as students at Williams College in Massachusetts. John was a member of the class of 1972 and Maggie was member of the class of 1973. In the years immediately after graduation, Maggie worked as a bookstore clerk, a pediatric receptionist, a substitute teacher, a casting agent and a talent agent, while John took jobs like nursing home orderly and meat packer. In the late '70s they moved to California for a few years. John worked for Roger Corman's New World Pictures, and Maggie worked as a salad chef.;  In 1979 they released their first film: Return of the Secaucus Seven (1979). John wrote the screenplay, and directed and edited the film. He also played the supporting role of Howie', a townie who has three kids before his 30th birthday. Maggie starred as 'Kate', the high school English teacher who invites all her college buddies up to her New Hampshire home for their annual reunion. She also served as Unit Manager and Assistant Editor.

University of Michigan Press Pasternak Records, 1958-1988 ",Philippine Islands,1,bioghist,"The University of Michigan Press was founded in 1930 with a goal of publishing books that would impart important scholarly research. In the late 1950s, as a reaction to Cold War era politics, the Press embarked on a program to publish Russian language materials. Their first undertaking was Boris Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago . Although Dr. Zhivago had been published in many languages, it had never before been printed in its original Russian. ;  A lengthy debate began between the Press and two other publishers. Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore, an Italian publisher, claimed to hold copyright as they had published an edition in 1957. In New York City, Pantheon Books, Inc. claimed to hold the rights to publications of the novel in English, having made previous arrangements with Feltrinelli. In February 1959, the Michigan Press entered into a licensing agreement with Feltrinelli and a similar agreement with Pantheon. Michigan was granted the right to distribute the novel in the United States, its territories and dependencies, in Canada, and in all other countries of the Western Hemisphere, the Philippine Islands, and Japan. Feltrinelli would publish in Europe, the Middle East, and all other countries not included in the agreement.;  Subsequent to the Dr. Zhivago publication, the Michigan Press published a translation of Pasternak's poetry. Russian-born Eugene M. Kayden, then an economics professor at the University of the South, undertook the translation. A few years later, Boris Filippov and Gleb Struve edited a three volume set of Pasternak's Collected Works .;  The collection was acquired by the Special Collections Library in June 1990."
