Alger Family Papers,Colony,1,bioghist,"         ; Russell Alexander Alger's uncle, David Baker Alger, married Margaret Richardson in the early 19th century, and by the mid-1800s the couple had settled in Richfield, Ohio.  They had four children, including:  Albert W. (b. 1849) and Richard Edwin (""R. E."" or ""Eddy"") Alger (1854-1943).  Albert resided in Colony, Kansas, in the early 20th century, and Richard remained in Richfield for most or all of his life.  Richard married Esther D. Reynolds, a strongly spiritual woman, on October 4, 1888.  The couple's children included Emma, Mary, Esther Marion, Margaret (b. 1890), and David Bruce (b. December 8, 1891).  ; David Bruce Alger attended Oberlin College in the early 1910s.  He graduated and had moved to Cleveland, Ohio, by 1916.  He married Clare Fleeman on October 13, 1916.  David Alger worked in the banking industry for much of his life and kept a series of short daily diaries from 1910 until 1973, which documented his time in Ohio, Texas, Missouri, and Florida.  Clare, an aspiring poet and writer, contributed to a variety of religious and literary publications throughout her life and was a member of the St. Louis Writers' Guild in the 1940s.; David Bruce and Clare Fleeman Alger's son, Bruce Reynolds Alger, was born in Dallas, Texas, on June 12, 1918. The family moved to Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Bruce Alger shared his father's love for football, played for his high school football team, and, later, on Princeton University's squad.  Following his graduation from Princeton (1940) and a brief stint as a field representative for the RCA Victor Manufacturing Company, Bruce enlisted in the Army Air Corps after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  He was stationed with the Fifth Squadron at the Army Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kerry Field, Texas, and he spent much of the war in training throughout the United States.  Bruce did see action in the Pacific theater in 1945, and spent time in Japan soon after the Japanese surrender.  Bruce received his discharge in November 1945, settled in Dallas, and pursued a career in real estate.  He later represented Texas' 5th District in the United States House of Representatives (1955-1965).  He returned to his real estate business in Dallas after a failed reelection bid."

Alger Family Papers,Death,1,bioghist,"         ; John Alger (ca. 1776-1818) was a descendent of a Connecticut-based branch of the Alger family.  He settled in Bethany, New York, sometime after the Revolutionary War.  John married Sarah Baker in 1798; they had at least six children, including Russell (b. 1809) and David (b. 1816).  The family migrated west, eventually settling in Richfield, Ohio.; After the Alger family moved to Ohio, Russell met Catherine Moulton, daughter of a prominent Massachusetts family, and the couple married in July 1832.  Their children were Charles, Sybil, and Russell Alexander (1836-1907).  Russell Alexander Alger was born in Lafayette Township, Ohio, on February 27, 1836.  Orphaned when he was 11 years old, Russell Alexander went to work on a farm in Richfield, Ohio.  He received his education at the Richfield Academy.  In 1857, he obtained a position in the law firm of Wolcott & Upsord in Akron, Ohio, and received formal admittance to the bar in March 1859.  Later that year, he left the legal profession for a career in the lumber industry in Grand Rapids, Michigan.; Russell A. Alger married Annette H. Henry of Grand Rapids on April 2, 1861.  He enlisted in the 2nd Michigan Cavalry the same year, and received a captain's commission on September 2.  He became major on April 2, 1862, lieutenant colonel of the 6th Michigan Cavalry on October 16, 1862, and colonel of the 5th Michigan Cavalry on February 7, 1863.  Alger's Civil War service included his capture at the Battle of Booneville, Mississippi (and subsequent escape), and participation in the Battle of Gettysburg.  Although he resigned his commission on September 20, 1864, he became brevet brigadier general of the United States Volunteers on June 11, 1864, with a promotion to major general a year later.  ; After the war, Russell Alger returned to Detroit and continued his steady ascent in the lumber industry, founded a succession of firms, and became particularly noteworthy in pine lumber business.  Success in the private sector led to a Republican Party nomination for the governorship of Michigan, an office he held from 1885-1887 (he declined to run for a second term).  Alger remained a locally and nationally prominent figure in the Republican Party throughout the late 19th century, and contended for U.S. Presidential nominations in 1888 and 1892.  He became secretary of war in William McKinley's cabinet in 1897 and served throughout the Spanish-American War, resigning on August 1, 1899.  Alger received public blame for the poor hygienic conditions endured by American soldiers in both Cuba and the United States during the war, which led to outbreaks of yellow fever and other diseases.; Alger returned to Detroit and succeeded United States Senator James McMillan, serving from September 27, 1902, until his death on January 24, 1907.  Russell Alexander Alger had nine children, including five who survived to adulthood:  Caroline (m. Henry Sheldon), Fay (m. William Elder Bailey), Frances (m. Charles Burrall Pike), Russell Alexander, Jr. (m. Marion Jarves), and Frederick Moulton.; "

Mark A. Anderson Collection of Post-Mortem Photography",Hygiene,1,bioghist,"Death; American death practices underwent dramatic changes in the 19th and early 20th century, with corresponding changes in society's attitudes and sentiments related to death and bereavement.  During the Victorian period, some one in five children did not reach adulthood; one in four soldiers died during the Civil War; and urbanization with its crowded conditions and poor sanitation increased morbidity and mortality rates.  With the advent of modern medicine, an increase in public health and hygiene, the rise of the modern funeral industry, and other factors, the prospects of an early death decreased and the care and disposition of the corpse moved from the family to professional workers.  These and other changes altered the ways people confronted the practical and psychological aspects of death and bereavement.; Memorial Photography; Post-mortem photographs are images taken of people after death.  Memorial or post-mortem photography was common from the birth of the daguerreotype in 1839 to the 1930s.  Deaths were frequent in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many people -- especially children -- had no photograph taken of them while living.  Post-mortem photography allowed people to have a likeness of their deceased family members; they used them to remember and mourn loved ones.; The roots of memorial photography are partly in the European tradition of painted miniatures.  Small portraits of the deceased were made into necklaces or pins.  Often hidden beneath clothing, these personal images allowed the wearer to grieve or to remember absent family or friends. With the technological innovation of photography in the 1830s, the bereaved were able to acquire an actual likeness of their mother, father, brother, sister, friend, etc. rather than an artist's rendering."

Mark A. Anderson Collection of Post-Mortem Photography",Philippine Islands,1,scopecontent,"; The first three subjects - post-mortem portraits, scenes, and funeral tableaux - all depict the recently deceased, and so fall into the narrowest definition of a post-mortem photograph.  Their distinction into three separate subjects is a partly arbitrary decision, made to break up what would otherwise be a large and unwieldy grouping of photos, but also to roughly shape the order of the collection (post-mortem portraits without décor tended to date earlier chronologically than broader, beautifying scenes).; Post-mortem portraits:; The post-mortem portrait photographs, comprising 203 items in the collection, depict the bodies of dead family members and friends.  These images show the deceased, sometimes posed with living family members, and for the most part do not include elements of a larger scene, such as floral arrangements, banners, or other décor.; These portraits include the earliest photographic images in the collection, including 27 cased daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes.  Fifty-eight cabinet card photographs date from the late 1860s to around the turn of the century.  Among many notable cabinet cards are two images of Frances Radke, taken and retouched by R. C. Houser, showing her image before and after Houser's post-capture work (3.1 and 3.2).  Also of note is a framed crayon enlargement of infant Adelaide Banks by photographer/artist Edward Stuart Tray (26).; Post-mortem scenes:; The post-mortem scene photographs, 141 items, are similar to the portraits described above, except that they show the deceased as part of a larger environment, whether in a private home, a funeral home, or out-of-doors.  Most of these views are mounted photographic prints from the 1880s to the early decades of the 20th century, frequently centering on the corpse, lying in a casket or coffin, amidst an abundance of floral arrangements, banners or flags, family members or friends, and/or personal belongings.  Their caskets are often lined with white cloth.  ; Many of these images have unique qualities; several examples illustrate the variety of postmortem scenes in the Mark Anderson collection.  Six photographs by W. Jakubowski and Co. and Jos. Ziawinski, of Detroit, Michigan, include five wedding photographs (of the bride and groom, bridesmaids, and family members) and one post-mortem scene of the wife.  She appears to have died within a short time following the marriage; the funeral home scene image contains one of the wedding photographs and a banner marked ""Dearest Wife"" (18.5-18.10).  One mounted photograph depicts a dog, laid on linen, in a homemade casket (14:17).  The collection also contains examples of different persons on display in the same funeral home/parlor (e.g. 18.1-18.4).  A set of two cabinet card photos of a child in a buggy is accompanied by one of the buggy's metal lanterns (23.1-23.3).  ; Funeral tableaux:; The collection's 31 funeral tableau photographs show the deceased in an open casket or coffin, typically in front of a church or homestead, with a posed assembly of funeral attendees or mourners.  They often show a large group of family and friends, and so are frequently large format prints.  Group portraits of this sort were occasionally framed and displayed in the home.  Most of the examples in this collection are large prints (many of them mounted), with smaller examples, including a real photo postcard, two snapshots, and one cabinet card.  Of note are a tableaux on the steps of the Church of The Descent of The Holy Ghost in Detroit by Thomas Hoffman (27), and a photomontage image of a nun's funeral (28).; Funerals and funeral processions:; 	The 60 items depicting or pertaining to funeral gatherings show various aspects of the movement of the deceased from the home or funeral home to the cemetery and funeral and burial ceremonies.  This group is comprised of real photo postcards (22 items), snapshots (13 items), and a variety of other formats.  Examples include an albumin print depicting the Plymouth Church, decorated for Henry Ward Beecher's funeral in 1887, and snapshot and postcard photographs of a burial at sea.; Floral arrangements and displays:; 	Additional documentation of funeral decoration may be found in the collection's 162 still life portraits of floral arrangements and other decorations.  A portion of the floral display photographs include pre- or post-mortem photos of the deceased either incorporated into the display or added to the image after printing.  One particularly fine example is a large format photograph of a floral arrangement for the funeral of Joshua Turner Mulls; the display included a cabinet card photo of Mr. Mulls and a modified enlargement of the cabinet card.  Accompanying the floral arrangement photograph is the cabinet card depicted in the display, with artist's instructions for coloring the enlargement (22.1-22.2). ; Memorial cards and sentimental imagery:; 	The collection includes 97 memorial cards and ephemeral items bearing sentimental imagery.  Memorial cards were created as tributes, often displaying birth dates, death dates, and other information about the deceased.  Many of these cards include border designs and some bear photographs of the departed.  Black-fronted memorial cards gained popularity from 1880 to 1905.  Of many interesting examples, the collection includes two examples of memorial cards which haven't yet been personalized (4.306-4.307) and two reflecting World War I related deaths (4.316 and 4.317).  Materials with sentimental imagery include items such as a photograph of an illustration entitled ""Momma is in Heaven,"" a memorial book dedicated to Olive C. Partridge in 1897, and other items.; Note:  an advertisement for the Memorial Card Company of Philadelphia is located in the 'Funeral Industry' section of the collection (14.35).; Cemeteries and monuments:; 	Sixty photographs, printed items, and realia explicitly pertain to cemeteries, burial markers, or monuments.  Some of the cemeteries and monuments are identified, such as the Garfield Memorial at Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio (4.1-4.3).  The collection includes examples of cemetery-related realia, including an ovular, porcelain headstone photograph (pre-mortem) of the deceased.; Note:  cemeteries may be seen as background for many photographs throughout the collection.; The funeral industry:; The Mark Anderson Collection of Post-Mortem Photography holds a diverse selection of photographs, ephemera, and printed materials related to the business aspects of death, dying, and bereavement.  This group includes receipts (1896-1956); various types of advertising (an undertaker's advertising card, a church fan, a thermometer, and other items); and 118 coffin sales photographs (illustrating a massive selection of different casket models offered by the Boyertown Burial Casket Company of Pennsylvania).; Two photograph albums, that of Clarence E. Mapes' furniture store and funeral home (and that of the Algoe-Gundry Company funeral home, provide visual documentation of a rural and an urban funeral home (respectively) in Michigan in the first half of the 20th century:; The photo album and scrapbook of Clarence E. Mapes' furniture store and funeral home in Durand, Michigan, dating from ca. 1903-1930, contains interior and exterior photographs of the furniture and undertaker portions of the shop.  The album includes photographs of casket showroom display mechanisms; an example of a ""burglar proof"" metallic vault; a posed photo of the embalmer standing over a man on the embalming table; images of carriage and motorized hearses; business-related newspaper clippings; and various family and vacation photographs.  Several prints, dated August 1903, appear to depict the aftermath of the Wallace Brothers Circus train wreck on the Grand Trunk railroad at Durand.  Among these photographs are carriage hearses, a horse-drawn cart carrying ten or more oblong boxes (for transportation and perhaps burial of victims of the wreck), a man standing in an alleyway near three stacked boxes, and a large group of persons standing in a largely unearthed section of a cemetery.  The Mapes album is accompanied by a C. E. Mapes Furniture advertising fly-swatter.; The Algoe-Gundry Company album dates from ca. 1924 to 1960 and contains (almost exclusively) 8""x10"" photographs of this Flint, Michigan, funeral business.  The album includes images of the exterior and interior of Algoe-Gundry buildings, hearses, ambulances, and billboard advertisements.; Mourning attire:; In America, mourning attire tended to follow trends set in Europe.  The bereaved wore mourning clothing according to current fashion trends and societal expectations.  Mourning clothing styles, often dark-colored and somber, depended on how close the mourner was to the deceased and local societal expectations.  Seventeen portrait photographs show men and women wearing mourning attire without the deceased present.  This group includes cabinet cards, a 1/9 plate ambrotype of an adult woman, two tintypes, and one carte-de-visite.; Note:  persons wearing mourning attire may also be found scattered throughout the other sections of the Mark A. Anderson collection.  While most are concentrated in the funeral photographs, mourners are also present in postmortem portraits, postmortem scenes, and cemetery photos.; Unnatural death:; Forty-three photographs (mostly snapshots) depict ""unnatural deaths,"" deaths not caused by age or naturally occurring disease, such as suicides, accidents, murders, and war.  The larger portions of the snapshots are mid-20th century police photographs of crime or accident scenes.  ; Nine Indiana State Police photographs show a train-automobile accident; a group of eight unmarked photos depict the body of woman, apparently violently murdered, at the location of her death and in a morgue; fourteen are of a man struck down, beneath a train; two are of a rifle suicide; and the others are of varying accidents.  One World War I-era real photo postcard appears to show a man, shot dead in a foxhole.  A stereoscopic card, by photographer B. W. Kilburn, shows the burial of Filipino soldiers after the Battle of Malolos, Philippine Islands [ca. 1897].; Note:  The photograph album/scrapbook of the Clarence E. Mapes furniture and undertakers shop contains several photographs of what appear to be the aftermath of the Wallace Brothers Circus train wreck, Durand, Michigan 1903 (see above description in the 'Funeral Industry' section of this scope and content note)."

Several prints, dated August 1903, appear to depict the aftermath of the Wallace Brothers Circus train wreck on the Grand Trunk railroad at Durand.  Among these photographs are carriage hearses, a horse-drawn cart carrying ten or more oblong boxes (for transportation and perhaps burial of victims of the wreck), a man standing in an alleyway near three stacked boxes, and a large group of persons standing in a largely unearthed section of a cemetery.  The Mapes album is accompanied by a C. E. Mapes Furniture advertising fly-swatter.; The Algoe-Gundry Company album dates from ca. 1924 to 1960 and contains (almost exclusively) 8""x10"" photographs of this Flint, Michigan, funeral business.  The album includes images of the exterior and interior of Algoe-Gundry buildings, hearses, ambulances, and billboard advertisements.; Mourning attire:; In America, mourning attire tended to follow trends set in Europe.  The bereaved wore mourning clothing according to current fashion trends and societal expectations.  Mourning clothing styles, often dark-colored and somber, depended on how close the mourner was to the deceased and local societal expectations.  Seventeen portrait photographs show men and women wearing mourning attire without the deceased present.  This group includes cabinet cards, a 1/9 plate ambrotype of an adult woman, two tintypes, and one carte-de-visite.; Note:  persons wearing mourning attire may also be found scattered throughout the other sections of the Mark A. Anderson collection.  While most are concentrated in the funeral photographs, mourners are also present in postmortem portraits, postmortem scenes, and cemetery photos.; Unnatural death:; Forty-three photographs (mostly snapshots) depict ""unnatural deaths,"" deaths not caused by age or naturally occurring disease, such as suicides, accidents, murders, and war.  The larger portions of the snapshots are mid-20th century police photographs of crime or accident scenes.  ; Nine Indiana State Police photographs show a train-automobile accident; a group of eight unmarked photos depict the body of woman, apparently violently murdered, at the location of her death and in a morgue; fourteen are of a man struck down, beneath a train; two are of a rifle suicide; and the others are of varying accidents.

Mark A. Anderson Collection of Post-Mortem Photography",Death,4,scopecontent,"; The first three subjects - post-mortem portraits, scenes, and funeral tableaux - all depict the recently deceased, and so fall into the narrowest definition of a post-mortem photograph.  Their distinction into three separate subjects is a partly arbitrary decision, made to break up what would otherwise be a large and unwieldy grouping of photos, but also to roughly shape the order of the collection (post-mortem portraits without décor tended to date earlier chronologically than broader, beautifying scenes).; Post-mortem portraits:; The post-mortem portrait photographs, comprising 203 items in the collection, depict the bodies of dead family members and friends.  These images show the deceased, sometimes posed with living family members, and for the most part do not include elements of a larger scene, such as floral arrangements, banners, or other décor.; These portraits include the earliest photographic images in the collection, including 27 cased daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes.  Fifty-eight cabinet card photographs date from the late 1860s to around the turn of the century.  Among many notable cabinet cards are two images of Frances Radke, taken and retouched by R. C. Houser, showing her image before and after Houser's post-capture work (3.1 and 3.2).  Also of note is a framed crayon enlargement of infant Adelaide Banks by photographer/artist Edward Stuart Tray (26).; Post-mortem scenes:; The post-mortem scene photographs, 141 items, are similar to the portraits described above, except that they show the deceased as part of a larger environment, whether in a private home, a funeral home, or out-of-doors.  Most of these views are mounted photographic prints from the 1880s to the early decades of the 20th century, frequently centering on the corpse, lying in a casket or coffin, amidst an abundance of floral arrangements, banners or flags, family members or friends, and/or personal belongings.  Their caskets are often lined with white cloth.  ; Many of these images have unique qualities; several examples illustrate the variety of postmortem scenes in the Mark Anderson collection.  Six photographs by W. Jakubowski and Co. and Jos. Ziawinski, of Detroit, Michigan, include five wedding photographs (of the bride and groom, bridesmaids, and family members) and one post-mortem scene of the wife.  She appears to have died within a short time following the marriage; the funeral home scene image contains one of the wedding photographs and a banner marked ""Dearest Wife"" (18.5-18.10).  One mounted photograph depicts a dog, laid on linen, in a homemade casket (14:17).  The collection also contains examples of different persons on display in the same funeral home/parlor (e.g. 18.1-18.4).  A set of two cabinet card photos of a child in a buggy is accompanied by one of the buggy's metal lanterns (23.1-23.3).  ; Funeral tableaux:; The collection's 31 funeral tableau photographs show the deceased in an open casket or coffin, typically in front of a church or homestead, with a posed assembly of funeral attendees or mourners.  They often show a large group of family and friends, and so are frequently large format prints.  Group portraits of this sort were occasionally framed and displayed in the home.  Most of the examples in this collection are large prints (many of them mounted), with smaller examples, including a real photo postcard, two snapshots, and one cabinet card.  Of note are a tableaux on the steps of the Church of The Descent of The Holy Ghost in Detroit by Thomas Hoffman (27), and a photomontage image of a nun's funeral (28).; Funerals and funeral processions:; 	The 60 items depicting or pertaining to funeral gatherings show various aspects of the movement of the deceased from the home or funeral home to the cemetery and funeral and burial ceremonies.  This group is comprised of real photo postcards (22 items), snapshots (13 items), and a variety of other formats.  Examples include an albumin print depicting the Plymouth Church, decorated for Henry Ward Beecher's funeral in 1887, and snapshot and postcard photographs of a burial at sea.; Floral arrangements and displays:; 	Additional documentation of funeral decoration may be found in the collection's 162 still life portraits of floral arrangements and other decorations.  A portion of the floral display photographs include pre- or post-mortem photos of the deceased either incorporated into the display or added to the image after printing.  One particularly fine example is a large format photograph of a floral arrangement for the funeral of Joshua Turner Mulls; the display included a cabinet card photo of Mr. Mulls and a modified enlargement of the cabinet card.  Accompanying the floral arrangement photograph is the cabinet card depicted in the display, with artist's instructions for coloring the enlargement (22.1-22.2). ; Memorial cards and sentimental imagery:; 	The collection includes 97 memorial cards and ephemeral items bearing sentimental imagery.  Memorial cards were created as tributes, often displaying birth dates, death dates, and other information about the deceased.  Many of these cards include border designs and some bear photographs of the departed.  Black-fronted memorial cards gained popularity from 1880 to 1905.  Of many interesting examples, the collection includes two examples of memorial cards which haven't yet been personalized (4.306-4.307) and two reflecting World War I related deaths (4.316 and 4.317).  Materials with sentimental imagery include items such as a photograph of an illustration entitled ""Momma is in Heaven,"" a memorial book dedicated to Olive C. Partridge in 1897, and other items.; Note:  an advertisement for the Memorial Card Company of Philadelphia is located in the 'Funeral Industry' section of the collection (14.35).; Cemeteries and monuments:; 	Sixty photographs, printed items, and realia explicitly pertain to cemeteries, burial markers, or monuments.  Some of the cemeteries and monuments are identified, such as the Garfield Memorial at Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio (4.1-4.3).  The collection includes examples of cemetery-related realia, including an ovular, porcelain headstone photograph (pre-mortem) of the deceased.; Note:  cemeteries may be seen as background for many photographs throughout the collection.; The funeral industry:; The Mark Anderson Collection of Post-Mortem Photography holds a diverse selection of photographs, ephemera, and printed materials related to the business aspects of death, dying, and bereavement.  This group includes receipts (1896-1956); various types of advertising (an undertaker's advertising card, a church fan, a thermometer, and other items); and 118 coffin sales photographs (illustrating a massive selection of different casket models offered by the Boyertown Burial Casket Company of Pennsylvania).; Two photograph albums, that of Clarence E. Mapes' furniture store and funeral home (and that of the Algoe-Gundry Company funeral home, provide visual documentation of a rural and an urban funeral home (respectively) in Michigan in the first half of the 20th century:; The photo album and scrapbook of Clarence E. Mapes' furniture store and funeral home in Durand, Michigan, dating from ca. 1903-1930, contains interior and exterior photographs of the furniture and undertaker portions of the shop.

Mark A. Anderson Collection of Post-Mortem Photography",Death,6,bioghist,"Death; American death practices underwent dramatic changes in the 19th and early 20th century, with corresponding changes in society's attitudes and sentiments related to death and bereavement.  During the Victorian period, some one in five children did not reach adulthood; one in four soldiers died during the Civil War; and urbanization with its crowded conditions and poor sanitation increased morbidity and mortality rates.  With the advent of modern medicine, an increase in public health and hygiene, the rise of the modern funeral industry, and other factors, the prospects of an early death decreased and the care and disposition of the corpse moved from the family to professional workers.  These and other changes altered the ways people confronted the practical and psychological aspects of death and bereavement.; Memorial Photography; Post-mortem photographs are images taken of people after death.  Memorial or post-mortem photography was common from the birth of the daguerreotype in 1839 to the 1930s.  Deaths were frequent in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many people -- especially children -- had no photograph taken of them while living.  Post-mortem photography allowed people to have a likeness of their deceased family members; they used them to remember and mourn loved ones.; The roots of memorial photography are partly in the European tradition of painted miniatures.  Small portraits of the deceased were made into necklaces or pins.  Often hidden beneath clothing, these personal images allowed the wearer to grieve or to remember absent family or friends. With the technological innovation of photography in the 1830s, the bereaved were able to acquire an actual likeness of their mother, father, brother, sister, friend, etc. rather than an artist's rendering."

William Henry Bisbee Collection",Death,1,bioghist,"Spanish-American War; The Spanish-American War, which began on April 14, 1898 and concluded on August 12, 1898, was a conflict between the United States and Spain that resulted in US acquisition of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico and Cuba's autonomy as a US protectorate.  It had its origins in the Cuban independence movement that began in 1895 and growing domestic pressure inside the United States to intervene in the conflict to protect American business interests in Cuba.; Spain, unprepared for war with a major power, was faced by a US Navy that had been modernized, trained, and well-equipped by the enthusiastic Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt.  In the Philippines, US forces worked alongside Filipino independence forces under Emilio Aguinaldo.  The United States Navy held Manila through most of the war, but Aguinaldo's forces controlled practically the entire rest of the archipelago.  With overwhelming US success in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, the war ended as a quick and decisive US victory.; Peace negotiations were held in Paris, and in the final treaty Spain relinquished rule of Cuba and ceded to the United States the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  As nominal payment for infrastructure in the Philippines, the United States agreed to pay Spain $20,000,000.  This Treaty of Paris was signed on December 10, 1898.  Though the treaty faced stiff opposition in the US Senate, it was ratified by a single vote on February 6, 1899.; Philippine-American War; The Philippine-American War was fought from 1899 to 1902 between the United States and Filipino independence forces.  The conflict was essentially a continuation of the Filipino struggle for independence from Spain, with revolutionaries under Emilio Aguinaldo resisting US rule just as they had resisted the Spanish.  Armed conflict between US and Filipino forces began on February 4, 1899, and by the end of that spring Filipino forces had ceased to engage US soldiers in conventional warfare, relying instead on guerilla tactics.; William Henry Bisbee; William Henry Bisbee was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, on January 28, 1840, to parents William Orson Bisbee and Harriet Miriam Ballou Bisbee.  He grew up in Woonsocket and spent his adolescent years as an apprentice in mercantile businesses in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Delaware, Ohio; and Denver, Colorado (before Colorado's admission to statehood).; Bisbee first joined the United States Army as a private on September 2, 1861, after the outbreak of the American Civil War.  Less than a year later, on June 9, 1862, he received his officer's commission at the rank of 2nd Lieutenant.  William H. Bisbee continued his service through the Civil War, including the Atlanta campaign under William Tecumseh Sherman, and campaigns of the American Indian Wars.  Rising through the ranks, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on May 4, 1897.; He commanded a regiment throughout the Santiago campaign of the Spanish-American War before returning the United States after peace was declared.  Following some administrative duties, during which time he was promoted to full Colonel on June 16, 1899, he was transferred.  On August 13, 1899, he joined a regiment in Manila, now fighting in the Philippine American War.  On October 2, 1901, he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General.; Upon his retirement in 1902, Bisbee settled in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he lived until his death.  On the occasion of his 100th birthday in 1940, he was awarded the Purple Heart in recognition of his service during the Civil War.  William H. Bisbee had three children: Raymond B. Bisbee, Katharine S. Fefel (nee Bisbee), and Eugene Shade Bisbee.  Bisbee died at the age of 102 on June 11, 1942, at his home in Brookline."

16,umich-wcl-M-3468.2bro,brownell_final.xml,Finding Aid for Brownell Family Papers,Races,1,bioghist,"Lucia Emilia DeWolf (1795-1884) was born in Bristol, Rhode Island, the daughter of Charles DeWolf and Elizabeth Rogerson. She married Pardon Brownell (1788-1846) in 1815, and had six children by him before he died in 1846. Her first four children were born in Providence, Rhode Island, and the last two in East Hartford, Connecticut. Two of her children died before the age of 16: Francis D. Brownell, her first born (1817-1833), and Emilia D. Brownell, her only daughter (1823-1838). Her surviving children were Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), Edward Rogerson Brownell (1825-1889), and Clarence Melville Brownell (1828-1862). After her husband's death, she moved back and forth between Bristol, Rhode Island, and East Hartford, Connecticut. The 1860 Census lists her as owing $51,500 of real estate. Her son Edward, a physician, made his home with her after his divorce, c.1864.; Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), the second child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, studied law, and became a practicing lawyer in Connecticut for a short time, before deciding to concentrate on writing. He published his first volume, Poems, in 1847, but it was as a Civil War poet that he was best known. At his own request, he was allowed to accompany Admiral Farragut into battle, so that he could write about it firsthand. He was made an ensign and acted as Admiral Farragut's secretary. After the Civil War he accompanied Farragut on a European tour. His book, Lyrics of a Day, or Newspaper Poetry, by a Volunteer in Service, was well reviewed by Oliver Wendell Holmes in an article entitled ""Our Battle Laureate"" in the May 1865 issue of the Atlantic Monthly. Holmes continued to encourage his writing efforts. Henry H. Brownell published War Lyrics and Other Poems in 1866, and is one of the people attributed with writing the lyrics for the song ""John Brown's Body."" He also wrote two popular histories for subscription publishers: The People's Book of Ancient and Modern History in 1851, and The Discoverers, Pioneers, and Settlers of North and South America in 1853. He developed cancer of the face, and underwent surgery in Boston, resulting in the removal of only part of the tumor. His last few years were painful. He made a trip to Florida with his brother Ned (Edward) in 1871-72 where they felt the warmer climate might make Henry more comfortable. At his death, the poet Thomas Bailey Aldrich eulogized him in a short poem, (“Henry Howard Brownell,” Atlantic Monthly, May 1873).; Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), the third child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a landscape artist. He spent seven consecutive winters in Cuba (1854-1861), traveled extensively throughout Europe (1871-1877), to Egypt in 1877, the Caribbean in 1888, and Jamaica in 1894, as well as to various parts of the U.S. Although trained as a lawyer, like his brother Henry, he soon decided against a law career. He took various jobs in Liberty, Virginia, from 1848-1849, and Alexandria, Louisiana, in 1850, and authored a book, The Indian Races of America in 1850, before deciding to concentrate on his painting. He studied with Julius Busch and Joseph Ropes in Hartford. His first works were exhibited at the Hartford Agricultural Society County fair in 1855, and he set up a studio in Hartford in 1857 -1858. In 1860, he moved to New York City and submitted work for sale at the National Academy of Design there in 1861-1862. He married Henrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) after her divorce from Dr. George A. Pierce in 1865 (see biography of Henrietta Knowlton Angell below). When not traveling abroad, they lived in Bristol, Rhode Island, with their four sons: Carl DeWolf Brownell born 1866, Ernest Henry Brownell born 1867, G. Edward Ibarra Brownell born 1870, and Roger Williams Brownell born 1876. His step daughter, Esther Pierce (b. 1860), sometimes lived with the family. His most well-known painting is ""The Connecticut Charter Oak.”; 	Edward Rogerson Brownell [Ned] (1825-1889), the fifth child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a physician like his father. He attended medical school in New Orleans, and was made a visiting physician at the Charity Hospital there while still a student. He took his diploma exam in 1850, and moved to rural Plaisance, Louisiana, where he married Pamela Laysard (b. in 1838, daughter of Malafret Laysard) in 1853. Edward tried to combine his medical practice in rural Louisiana with raising cotton, but had little success in the cotton business. He and Pamela had six children before they became embroiled in a bitter separation. The oldest child, Francis (b. 1854), came back East with his father prior to 1866, and in the 1880 Census was living with a great aunt in Hartford, Connecticut. The other four living children (Lucia b. 1857, Arthur b. 1859, Clarence b. 1860, and Charles b. 1862) stayed in Louisiana with their mother. The 1910 Census lists Pamela L. Brownell as living in Rapides County, Louisiana, at age 70, with only one of her six children still alive. Edward [Ned] spent the years after his marital separation living with his mother in Bristol, Rhode Island, and is listed in the 1880 Census as an ""alopathic physician"".; 	Clarence Melville Brownell, the youngest child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was born May 2, 1828, in East Harford, Connecticut, and died in May 1862, on the White Nile River in Central Africa [Lat. 8 N.] at the age of 34. He never married. Despite being trained as a physician and having built up a thriving medical practice in East Hartford (1853-1859), he had a strong desire to travel to remote areas. In November 1859, he left for Callao, Peru, and made a trip down the Amazon. In 1860, he traveled to St. Thomas and Cuba. In 1861 he visited his brother Ned in rural Cloutierville, Louisiana, and then left for Alexandria, Egypt, via Marseille, expecting to be gone two years. In late October a letter was forwarded to him in Marseille offering him a captaincy in a Connecticut Regiment, which he had been most eager to have. But, because he had already begun his trip to Egypt, he decided to go on. In Khartoum he met John Pethernick and joined his expedition to the source of the White Nile, agreeing to make botanical collections for them. Brownell kept a diary from January 1, 1862, to May 13, 1862 [typescript at the University of Durham, England], describing his travels, as well as the flora and fauna he encountered. The diary ended about a week before his death when he became too ill to write. John Pethernick's wife wrote an account of his death in Travels in Central Africa, published in 1869 in London.; 	Henrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) was the daughter of Henry Angell and Rebecca Knowlton of Rhode Island. She married Dr. George A. Pierce in February 1859. They had two children, Esther H. Pierce (b. 1860) and Henry A. Pierce (1863-1867), before divorcing. In 1865, Henrietta married the artist Charles DeWolf Brownell, by whom she had four sons: Carl D. Brownell, b. 1866; Ernest Henry Brownell, b. 1867; G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell, b.1870; and Roger Williams Brownell, b. 1876. She and the children accompanied Charles to Europe in the 1870s. At some point she converted to Catholicism, and published two long stories in serial form in the journal Catholic World. One was called Donna Quixote (1882) and the other Out of the West (1883). She also wrote God's Way, Man's Way - A History of Bristol, Rhode Island, and submitted articles to the Phoenix. It was at her request and with her financial support that four Sisters of Mercy from Providence, Rhode Island, were sent across to Newfoundland's west coast to found the first Sisters of Mercy house there in 1893.; Henritetta Knowlton Angell and Charles DeWolf Brownell's son Ernest Henry Brownell was born in 1867. He graduated from Brown University in 1888 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890. He was an instructor in civil engineering at Brown University in the 1890s. Beginning in 1902, he served as an officer in the United States Navy Civil Engineer Corps, holding positions at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; New York, New York; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Florida; and Washington, D.C. In 1891 he married Annie May Angell (1866-1958). Together they had four children: John Angell Brownell (1892-1977), Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982), Margaret Knowlton Brownell (1895-1977), and Thomas Church Brownell (1898-1953). He died in 1945 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island.; Annie May Angell Brownell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1866 to John Arnold Angell (1837-1877) and Annie Wardwell Usher Angell (1840-1898). Her siblings included Bertha Angell (1868-1928), John Wardwell Angell (1870-1927), and Elsie Angell (1875-1877). Her paternal grandparents were John Angell (b. 1794) and Nancy Arnold Angell (1798-1876). From 1910 to 1940, she is listed in the United States Federal Censuses as a patient in the Butler Hospital for the Insane. She died in 1958 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island.; Bertha Angell, born in 1868, was Annie May Angell Brownell's sister. In 1902 she married Lewis Howe Kalloch (b. 1867), a dentist, and in 1904 she gave birth to Lewis Howe Kalloch, Jr. They appear to have been involved in business with Ernest and Annie May Brownell. She died in 1928.; Annie May Angell Brownell and Ernest Henry Brownell's daughter Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982) graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. She married Clifford Kyler Rathbone (1893-1944) in 1923. Clifford's parents were John K. Rathbone and Myrtle Petty Rathbone of Denton, Texas. Clifford Rathbone worked in construction, listed as a contractor in the 1930 United States Federal Census and an architectural engineer in 1940. He had at least one sibling, Rosalie Rathbone (1891-1976), who married William A. Craft (1894-1963) in 1950. Both Rosalie and William Craft taught at Iowa State. ; Together Dorothea and Clifford Rathbone had two children, Dorinda Rathbone (1924-2009) and Henry Brownell Rathbone (1925-1951). Dorinda Rathbone attended the University of Washington and married Carlos Dew, Jr., in 1946. Henry Rathbone graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. He was killed during the Korean War while serving in the United States Navy.; Other figures in the collection are noted below. ; 	Procer Wright was probably an Englishman.  He seems to have met Charles and Henrietta Brownell in San Raphael, France, in 1876.  He and Henrietta Brownell became friends and corresponded between 1876 and 1884, when Wright was traveling through Europe. ; 	Don Manuel Ibarra was a Spaniard married to a Cuban woman.  He worked at the San Martin sugar refinery (""ingenio"") near Cardenas, Cuba.  He was probably the refinery manager, but could have been a partial owner.  He worked in Cuba from 1855-1870, returning to Barcelona, Spain, by 1871, perhaps because of the unrest caused by the Cuban ""Ten-Year War"" which started in October of 1868 and involved bloody clashes between Cuban independence seekers and Spanish troops.  Ibarra met Charles Brownell in Cuba. They became such close friends that Brownell named his third son born in 1870, after Ibarra (G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell).; 	Lucy Larcom (1824-1893) was a poet, author and editor.  She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Larcom and Lois Barrett.  After her father's death, the family moved to Lowell, where her mother kept a boarding house, and Lucy worked in the mills for ten years.  Through a literary club at the mills, she met John G. Whittier who encouraged her to write.  She accompanied a married sister to Illinois where she taught school for three years before attending Monticello Female Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, for three years.  She returned to Beverly, Massachusetts, and taught for six years at Wheaton Female Seminary, where she met Henrietta Angell [Brownell]. When her health began to fail, she resigned and took a position editing the children's magazine Our Young Folks.  She continued to write and publish her own poetry and prose.  She never married.; 	Henrietta Silliman Dana (1823-1907) was the daughter of Benjamin Silliman, a professor at Yale, and Harriet Trumbell.  In 1844, she married James Dwight Dana who became a renown professor of geology at Yale.  He accompanied the Charles Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific in the early 1840's, and then became Silliman Professor of Natural History and Geology at Yale until several years before he died in 1895.  He wrote classical works on geology and mineralogy.  The Danas had six children, but lost two of them to diphtheria in 1861.  Their son, Edward (b. 1849), also became a professor at Yale."
17,umich-wcl-M-3468.2bro,brownell_final.xml,Finding Aid for Brownell Family Papers,Slave,1,scopecontent,"The Brownell family papers contain correspondence, diaries, documents, writings, illustrations, and other materials documenting the family's experiences from the 1820s into the 1960s.; The Correspondence Series includes letters written to and by the Brownell family, primarily in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Louisiana, New York City, Cuba, and France between 1823 and 1969, with the bulk dating from the 1850s to 1940s. ; Approximately 296 letters are letters to Charles Brownell and his wife Henrietta [Nettie] from Charles' mother, Lucia [Mummy], and his three brothers, Edward [Ned], Henry, and Clarence, often written with notes added and sent on as a ""round robin"" correspondence which ended with Charles. ; 	The collection contains over 100 letters written by Ned Brownell, with additional notes in other family members' letters. His earliest letters start when he is finishing medical school in New Orleans and continue with his move to rural Louisiana, near Alexandria and Plaisance. These are high-spirited letters with humorous pen and ink drawings of his adventures chasing wild horses (January 29, 1855); mishaps while duck and geese hunting at Lake Catahoula (November 12, 1855; November 10, 1856); and futile attempts to flag down a river steamer (January 29, 1855). But his letters also deal with the problems involved in setting up a medical practice at the same time he, a Northerner, is trying his hand at cotton cultivation. He married a southern woman of French descent whose father  was a slave owner (19 slaves in 1850 and 30 in 1860). Ned describes bringing up his bilingual children in a culture very different from his own. The marriage s was troubled, and by 1858, he sold out his cotton interests and was considering his brother Clarence's offer to take over Clarence's practice in East Hartford, Connecticut. He moved to Cloutierville, Louisiana, for a while. Two letters of introduction written in 1864 (April 4 and April 25) refer to his allegiance to the Union. By June of 1866, he was involved in legal separation hearings and working with his brothers on a testimony about his wife's ""violent scenes and words.” Both during his practice in Louisiana and later in Rhode Island, his letters describe his patients and treatments (cotton gin accident resulting in amputation of an enslaved person's arm - October 26, 1857; treating yellow fever and typhoid - October 14, 1853 and January 12, 1855). He also suggests treatments for family members with diphtheria (n.d. November 8), excessive menstrual bleeding (December 17, 1866), prolapsed uterus after childbirth (February 8, [1867]), and a prescription for a cholera prevention pill (n.d. September 27). He made a trip to Florida with his dying brother Henry in 1871-1872, in the hopes that the warmer climate might make Henry feel more comfortable.; 	Only a handful of letters and notes are from Clarence Brownell. Seven of these are affectionate letters to his friend Henrietta Angell [Pierce] [Brownell], before and during her first unhappy marriage. The rest of his letters are to his family and include descriptions of his 1861 visit to Ned and family in Cloutierville, his excitement and satisfaction in building a boat in his workshop, and playing chess by mail with brother Charles. Another letter describes his travels in Egypt. He went by horseback from Alexandria to Cairo, 130 miles across the Delta. A map he drew while with the Pethernick Expedition on the White Nile was sent home posthumously ([May 12], 1862). On it he notes their location by date and the location of certain flora and fauna.; 	Over 100 letters and notes are from Lucia D. Brownell (""Mummy""), most of them dealing with local affairs, real estate arrangements, and concerns for her sons' health. Several of these letters mention mediums and the spirit world. After the death of her son Clarence in Egypt, Lucia, Ned, and Henry become interested in reports of mediums and ""spiritual pictures.” One item is a copy of a letter that a medium claimed was dictated to him by Clarence's ghost. Ned describes watching a medium who claimed to see ""words in fiery letters in the illuminated smoke of my cigar when I puffed"" [13 May]. Lucia made several visits to a medium (November- December 1862), ending when the medium was proved a fake.; 	Correspondence with Henry H. Brownell is well represented. The letters mostly come from Hartford, Connecticut, but letters from Bristol, Rhode Island, are also included. He describes visiting Ned and his family in Louisiana in the 1850s, and accompanying Ned on three of his annual duck and geese hunting expeditions to Lake Catahoula. He seems to have acted as agent for the sale of his brother Charles' paintings when Charles was away in Cuba or Europe - ""two little Charter Oaks for $20."" [n.d. December 26]. Other letters deal with business matters concerning an inheritance from his grandfather De Wolf involving real estate that he and Charles shared, but unequally. These letters contain little mention of Henry's own writing of poetry and the publication of his books. Two copies of letters to Henry written by Oliver Wendell Holmes praising his work are included [January 13 and February 6, 1865]. A typed copy of a letter from Ernest H. Brownell, dated April 6, 1935, lists letters written by Holmes to Henry H. Brownell. Correspondence to Charles DeWolf Brownell represent his work to honor and publish his brother's writings after his death [late 1880s].; 	Another part of the Brownell Papers consists of three batches of letters from abroad - the Procter Wright letters from Europe, the Charles and Nettie Brownell letters from Europe, and the Don Martin Ibarra letters from Cuba and Spain. Procter Wright wrote 25 letters (1876-1884) to Mrs. Charles Brownell (Nettie) from Italy, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. He gives good descriptions of his walking and climbing tours as well as his visits to various cities. A few letters discuss religion, including matters of purgatory [April 28, 1880] and creation or Darwinisn [August 18, 1883]. Wright also mentions the death of the artist Jean Louis Hamon, and the auction of his things [July 26, 1876, December 28, 1876]. He reminds Henrietta how much he treasures Charles' painting of ""Witches' Cork Tree"" that the Brownell's had given him some years earlier [April 9, 1883].; 	The twenty letters written by Charles and Nettie in Europe (1872-1874) to family at home talk of their travels, their children, and anything unusual that catches their eye - ""Creche"" day care system in France [August 20, 1873] or a trip to the ""Crystal Palace"" in London [August 29, 1873]. Charles made small pen and ink drawings on three of the letters - a bird on a branch [July 28, 1872], an Egyptian ""cartouche"" [May 6, 1873], and a dental molar [March 27, 1874]. Three other letterheads have hand tinted designs - an animal head [August 9, 1872], a ship [May 8, 1874], and boys on a ship's mast [May 13, 1874]. Two letterheads have landscape lithographs by Henry Besley - ""St. Michael's Mount from Lower Tremenheere"" [August 20, 1873] , ""Penzance from Guvul"" and ""St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall"" [August 22, 1873].; 	The Don Martin Ibarra letters (1855-1872) consist of 86 letters written in Spanish to Charles Brownell. They are mainly from Cuba, but the last several are from Barcelona, Spain. They are warm letters to a good friend and ""compadre,” but also contain figures on the production of sugar from at least two ""ingenios"" or sugar mills near the Cardenas area of Cuba.; 	A small group of 17 letters from the poet Lucy Larcom (1862-1870, n.d.) were written to Henrietta Angell Pierce Brownell [Mrs. Charles Brownell], and cover the years of Larcom's decision to stop teaching school and to concentrate her energy on her own writing. Her September 19, 1868, letter mentions proofreading a volume for publication, ""my cricket-chirpings of verse.”; 	Eight letters from Henrietta S. Dana (1861-1863) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Henrietta A. Pierce [Brownell] mention Mrs. Dana helping her famous Yale professor husband by taking dictation from him for his most recent book, Manuel of Geology [April 7, 1862]. Her letters also describe the death of two of their children from diphtheria, and her safely nursing one other child through it [December 21, 1861].; Twenty-five letters from Esther Pierce to her divorced and remarried mother, Henrietta Brownell, were written from 1875-1877, when Esther was 14-16 years old and living with her father, Dr. George Pierce, in Providence. Several years earlier, she had been living with her mother and her step-father, Charles Brownell, and had accompanied them on their trip to Europe. Her nickname was ""Kit,” and she is frequently mentioned in her mother's letters. The letters from Esther [Kit] tell of a trip to Canada, local people and visits, and her new clothes, sometimes with accompanying pen and ink drawings. Two letters include swatches of fabric [February 6, 1876, and April 23, 1876]. ; More correspondence to and from the Brownells can be found in the Scrapbook Pages series and the Genealogical Notes and Copies series.; Beginning in the 1880s, the correspondence focuses more on Annie May Angell, who would marry Ernest Henry Brownell in 1891, and her family. Virginia McLain (1867-1953), who lived in the Bahamas as the daughter of the United States Consul Thomas J. McClain, was a frequent correspondent into the 1890s. One letter dated October 11, 1887, includes a carte-de-visite of Virginia. Other letters in the 1880s relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell's efforts to publish his brother Henry Howard Brownell's poetry. Several letters from 1882 and 1883 relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell, his work on the Charter Oak, and his paintings. One letter by Oliver Wendell Holmes, dated February 11, 1883, indicates one of Charles' paintings was displayed in his library.; Correspondence from the 1890s-1910s centers around Annie May and Ernest Brownell, as well as their family circle and acquaintances. Letters written by Bertha Angell to Lewis Kalloch are also well represented in this period. Ernest's letters provide details about May and Ernest's children and marriage, as well as Ernest's work as a Civil Engineer in the United States Navy. Many of his early letters are addressed from the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Navy Yard. Ernest was also stationed in the Philippines and Bremerton, Washington.; Around 1905 Ernest Brownell became involved with the Brownell Building in Providence, Rhode Island, which the brothers inherited, and in the following years corresponded with his brothers Carl and Edward about various matters relating to family properties. Several letters from 1912 refer to a large fire at the Brownell Building.; Two items from August 1915 were sent to the family of John K. Rathbone relating to the Galveston Hurricane.; Correspondence between Dorothea DeWolf Brownell and Clifford Kyler Rathbone begins around 1918. Clifford Rathbone's letters also detail his career in construction. Material from the 1920s relates to family finances and handling of Kalloch estate matters. By the 1930s letters by Dorinda Rathbone begin appearing, as well as more letters from the Rathbone family, including Myrtle Rathbone of Denton, Texas, and Rosalie Rathbone. ; Correspondence from 1942-1943 reflects Clifford Rathbone's unsuccessful efforts to join the military, and Henry B. Rathbone's preparation for the U.S. Naval Academy entrance exams. Following Clifford Rathbone's death in March of 1944, the collection includes many condolence letters. The bulk of the correspondence post-1945 is written to Dorinda Rathbone.; The Bundled Correspondence Sub-series is comprised of letters arranged by later descendants of the family. The first bundle of seven letters spans from December 20, 1820, to January 29, 1825, relating to Pardon and Lucia Brownell's inheritance from the estate of Lucia's father Charles DeWolf. It includes notes by Dorothea DeWolf Brownell Rathbone. The second bundle includes 16 letters written to Pardon Brownell enclosed in Florence Brownell's January 19, 1931, letter to Dorothea Rathbone, spanning from March 1825 to December 1835 and primarily concern affairs with a DeWolf family property. One letter from Lucia DeWolf Brownell, dated June 11-13, 1827, is also included. The third bundle consists of 26 letters written from Ernest Brownell to his wife Annie May Angell Brownell from 1904 to 1940, along with a blank postcard and a photograph, likely of Ernest and Annie May, with the inscription ""In Cuba on The Honeymoon, 1891"" written on the verso. The letters commemorate their wedding anniversary, and were written while Ernest was serving in the Navy in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Pensacola, Florida; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and Newport, Rhode Island. The fourth bundle consists of two letters sent by John T. Lewis, Jr., to Dorothea Rathbone in the mid-1960s, enclosing two letters by H. M. K. Brownell from 1881 and 1883, respectively.; TheDiaries and Notebooks Series  includes the following:; Francis DeWolf Brownell Penmanship Exercise Book, ca. 1833""The Lay of the Cuisinier.

18,umich-wcl-M-3468.2bro,brownell_final.xml,Finding Aid for Brownell Family Papers,Enslaved,1,scopecontent,"The Brownell family papers contain correspondence, diaries, documents, writings, illustrations, and other materials documenting the family's experiences from the 1820s into the 1960s.; The Correspondence Series includes letters written to and by the Brownell family, primarily in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Louisiana, New York City, Cuba, and France between 1823 and 1969, with the bulk dating from the 1850s to 1940s. ; Approximately 296 letters are letters to Charles Brownell and his wife Henrietta [Nettie] from Charles' mother, Lucia [Mummy], and his three brothers, Edward [Ned], Henry, and Clarence, often written with notes added and sent on as a ""round robin"" correspondence which ended with Charles. ; 	The collection contains over 100 letters written by Ned Brownell, with additional notes in other family members' letters. His earliest letters start when he is finishing medical school in New Orleans and continue with his move to rural Louisiana, near Alexandria and Plaisance. These are high-spirited letters with humorous pen and ink drawings of his adventures chasing wild horses (January 29, 1855); mishaps while duck and geese hunting at Lake Catahoula (November 12, 1855; November 10, 1856); and futile attempts to flag down a river steamer (January 29, 1855). But his letters also deal with the problems involved in setting up a medical practice at the same time he, a Northerner, is trying his hand at cotton cultivation. He married a southern woman of French descent whose father  was a slave owner (19 slaves in 1850 and 30 in 1860). Ned describes bringing up his bilingual children in a culture very different from his own. The marriage s was troubled, and by 1858, he sold out his cotton interests and was considering his brother Clarence's offer to take over Clarence's practice in East Hartford, Connecticut. He moved to Cloutierville, Louisiana, for a while. Two letters of introduction written in 1864 (April 4 and April 25) refer to his allegiance to the Union. By June of 1866, he was involved in legal separation hearings and working with his brothers on a testimony about his wife's ""violent scenes and words.” Both during his practice in Louisiana and later in Rhode Island, his letters describe his patients and treatments (cotton gin accident resulting in amputation of an enslaved person's arm - October 26, 1857; treating yellow fever and typhoid - October 14, 1853 and January 12, 1855). He also suggests treatments for family members with diphtheria (n.d. November 8), excessive menstrual bleeding (December 17, 1866), prolapsed uterus after childbirth (February 8, [1867]), and a prescription for a cholera prevention pill (n.d. September 27). He made a trip to Florida with his dying brother Henry in 1871-1872, in the hopes that the warmer climate might make Henry feel more comfortable.; 	Only a handful of letters and notes are from Clarence Brownell. Seven of these are affectionate letters to his friend Henrietta Angell [Pierce] [Brownell], before and during her first unhappy marriage. The rest of his letters are to his family and include descriptions of his 1861 visit to Ned and family in Cloutierville, his excitement and satisfaction in building a boat in his workshop, and playing chess by mail with brother Charles. Another letter describes his travels in Egypt. He went by horseback from Alexandria to Cairo, 130 miles across the Delta. A map he drew while with the Pethernick Expedition on the White Nile was sent home posthumously ([May 12], 1862). On it he notes their location by date and the location of certain flora and fauna.; 	Over 100 letters and notes are from Lucia D. Brownell (""Mummy""), most of them dealing with local affairs, real estate arrangements, and concerns for her sons' health. Several of these letters mention mediums and the spirit world. After the death of her son Clarence in Egypt, Lucia, Ned, and Henry become interested in reports of mediums and ""spiritual pictures.” One item is a copy of a letter that a medium claimed was dictated to him by Clarence's ghost. Ned describes watching a medium who claimed to see ""words in fiery letters in the illuminated smoke of my cigar when I puffed"" [13 May]. Lucia made several visits to a medium (November- December 1862), ending when the medium was proved a fake.; 	Correspondence with Henry H. Brownell is well represented. The letters mostly come from Hartford, Connecticut, but letters from Bristol, Rhode Island, are also included. He describes visiting Ned and his family in Louisiana in the 1850s, and accompanying Ned on three of his annual duck and geese hunting expeditions to Lake Catahoula. He seems to have acted as agent for the sale of his brother Charles' paintings when Charles was away in Cuba or Europe - ""two little Charter Oaks for $20."" [n.d. December 26]. Other letters deal with business matters concerning an inheritance from his grandfather De Wolf involving real estate that he and Charles shared, but unequally. These letters contain little mention of Henry's own writing of poetry and the publication of his books. Two copies of letters to Henry written by Oliver Wendell Holmes praising his work are included [January 13 and February 6, 1865]. A typed copy of a letter from Ernest H. Brownell, dated April 6, 1935, lists letters written by Holmes to Henry H. Brownell. Correspondence to Charles DeWolf Brownell represent his work to honor and publish his brother's writings after his death [late 1880s].; 	Another part of the Brownell Papers consists of three batches of letters from abroad - the Procter Wright letters from Europe, the Charles and Nettie Brownell letters from Europe, and the Don Martin Ibarra letters from Cuba and Spain. Procter Wright wrote 25 letters (1876-1884) to Mrs. Charles Brownell (Nettie) from Italy, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. He gives good descriptions of his walking and climbing tours as well as his visits to various cities. A few letters discuss religion, including matters of purgatory [April 28, 1880] and creation or Darwinisn [August 18, 1883]. Wright also mentions the death of the artist Jean Louis Hamon, and the auction of his things [July 26, 1876, December 28, 1876]. He reminds Henrietta how much he treasures Charles' painting of ""Witches' Cork Tree"" that the Brownell's had given him some years earlier [April 9, 1883].; 	The twenty letters written by Charles and Nettie in Europe (1872-1874) to family at home talk of their travels, their children, and anything unusual that catches their eye - ""Creche"" day care system in France [August 20, 1873] or a trip to the ""Crystal Palace"" in London [August 29, 1873]. Charles made small pen and ink drawings on three of the letters - a bird on a branch [July 28, 1872], an Egyptian ""cartouche"" [May 6, 1873], and a dental molar [March 27, 1874]. Three other letterheads have hand tinted designs - an animal head [August 9, 1872], a ship [May 8, 1874], and boys on a ship's mast [May 13, 1874]. Two letterheads have landscape lithographs by Henry Besley - ""St. Michael's Mount from Lower Tremenheere"" [August 20, 1873] , ""Penzance from Guvul"" and ""St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall"" [August 22, 1873].; 	The Don Martin Ibarra letters (1855-1872) consist of 86 letters written in Spanish to Charles Brownell. They are mainly from Cuba, but the last several are from Barcelona, Spain. They are warm letters to a good friend and ""compadre,” but also contain figures on the production of sugar from at least two ""ingenios"" or sugar mills near the Cardenas area of Cuba.; 	A small group of 17 letters from the poet Lucy Larcom (1862-1870, n.d.) were written to Henrietta Angell Pierce Brownell [Mrs. Charles Brownell], and cover the years of Larcom's decision to stop teaching school and to concentrate her energy on her own writing. Her September 19, 1868, letter mentions proofreading a volume for publication, ""my cricket-chirpings of verse.”; 	Eight letters from Henrietta S. Dana (1861-1863) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Henrietta A. Pierce [Brownell] mention Mrs. Dana helping her famous Yale professor husband by taking dictation from him for his most recent book, Manuel of Geology [April 7, 1862]. Her letters also describe the death of two of their children from diphtheria, and her safely nursing one other child through it [December 21, 1861].; Twenty-five letters from Esther Pierce to her divorced and remarried mother, Henrietta Brownell, were written from 1875-1877, when Esther was 14-16 years old and living with her father, Dr. George Pierce, in Providence. Several years earlier, she had been living with her mother and her step-father, Charles Brownell, and had accompanied them on their trip to Europe. Her nickname was ""Kit,” and she is frequently mentioned in her mother's letters. The letters from Esther [Kit] tell of a trip to Canada, local people and visits, and her new clothes, sometimes with accompanying pen and ink drawings. Two letters include swatches of fabric [February 6, 1876, and April 23, 1876]. ; More correspondence to and from the Brownells can be found in the Scrapbook Pages series and the Genealogical Notes and Copies series.; Beginning in the 1880s, the correspondence focuses more on Annie May Angell, who would marry Ernest Henry Brownell in 1891, and her family. Virginia McLain (1867-1953), who lived in the Bahamas as the daughter of the United States Consul Thomas J. McClain, was a frequent correspondent into the 1890s. One letter dated October 11, 1887, includes a carte-de-visite of Virginia. Other letters in the 1880s relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell's efforts to publish his brother Henry Howard Brownell's poetry. Several letters from 1882 and 1883 relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell, his work on the Charter Oak, and his paintings. One letter by Oliver Wendell Holmes, dated February 11, 1883, indicates one of Charles' paintings was displayed in his library.; Correspondence from the 1890s-1910s centers around Annie May and Ernest Brownell, as well as their family circle and acquaintances. Letters written by Bertha Angell to Lewis Kalloch are also well represented in this period. Ernest's letters provide details about May and Ernest's children and marriage, as well as Ernest's work as a Civil Engineer in the United States Navy. Many of his early letters are addressed from the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Navy Yard. Ernest was also stationed in the Philippines and Bremerton, Washington.; Around 1905 Ernest Brownell became involved with the Brownell Building in Providence, Rhode Island, which the brothers inherited, and in the following years corresponded with his brothers Carl and Edward about various matters relating to family properties. Several letters from 1912 refer to a large fire at the Brownell Building.; Two items from August 1915 were sent to the family of John K. Rathbone relating to the Galveston Hurricane.; Correspondence between Dorothea DeWolf Brownell and Clifford Kyler Rathbone begins around 1918. Clifford Rathbone's letters also detail his career in construction. Material from the 1920s relates to family finances and handling of Kalloch estate matters. By the 1930s letters by Dorinda Rathbone begin appearing, as well as more letters from the Rathbone family, including Myrtle Rathbone of Denton, Texas, and Rosalie Rathbone. ; Correspondence from 1942-1943 reflects Clifford Rathbone's unsuccessful efforts to join the military, and Henry B. Rathbone's preparation for the U.S. Naval Academy entrance exams. Following Clifford Rathbone's death in March of 1944, the collection includes many condolence letters. The bulk of the correspondence post-1945 is written to Dorinda Rathbone.; The Bundled Correspondence Sub-series is comprised of letters arranged by later descendants of the family. The first bundle of seven letters spans from December 20, 1820, to January 29, 1825, relating to Pardon and Lucia Brownell's inheritance from the estate of Lucia's father Charles DeWolf. It includes notes by Dorothea DeWolf Brownell Rathbone. The second bundle includes 16 letters written to Pardon Brownell enclosed in Florence Brownell's January 19, 1931, letter to Dorothea Rathbone, spanning from March 1825 to December 1835 and primarily concern affairs with a DeWolf family property. One letter from Lucia DeWolf Brownell, dated June 11-13, 1827, is also included. The third bundle consists of 26 letters written from Ernest Brownell to his wife Annie May Angell Brownell from 1904 to 1940, along with a blank postcard and a photograph, likely of Ernest and Annie May, with the inscription ""In Cuba on The Honeymoon, 1891"" written on the verso. The letters commemorate their wedding anniversary, and were written while Ernest was serving in the Navy in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Pensacola, Florida; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and Newport, Rhode Island. The fourth bundle consists of two letters sent by John T. Lewis, Jr., to Dorothea Rathbone in the mid-1960s, enclosing two letters by H. M. K.

21,umich-wcl-M-3468.2bro,brownell_final.xml,Finding Aid for Brownell Family Papers,Death,5,bioghist,"Lucia Emilia DeWolf (1795-1884) was born in Bristol, Rhode Island, the daughter of Charles DeWolf and Elizabeth Rogerson. She married Pardon Brownell (1788-1846) in 1815, and had six children by him before he died in 1846. Her first four children were born in Providence, Rhode Island, and the last two in East Hartford, Connecticut. Two of her children died before the age of 16: Francis D. Brownell, her first born (1817-1833), and Emilia D. Brownell, her only daughter (1823-1838). Her surviving children were Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), Edward Rogerson Brownell (1825-1889), and Clarence Melville Brownell (1828-1862). After her husband's death, she moved back and forth between Bristol, Rhode Island, and East Hartford, Connecticut. The 1860 Census lists her as owing $51,500 of real estate. Her son Edward, a physician, made his home with her after his divorce, c.1864.; Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), the second child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, studied law, and became a practicing lawyer in Connecticut for a short time, before deciding to concentrate on writing. He published his first volume, Poems, in 1847, but it was as a Civil War poet that he was best known. At his own request, he was allowed to accompany Admiral Farragut into battle, so that he could write about it firsthand. He was made an ensign and acted as Admiral Farragut's secretary. After the Civil War he accompanied Farragut on a European tour. His book, Lyrics of a Day, or Newspaper Poetry, by a Volunteer in Service, was well reviewed by Oliver Wendell Holmes in an article entitled ""Our Battle Laureate"" in the May 1865 issue of the Atlantic Monthly. Holmes continued to encourage his writing efforts. Henry H. Brownell published War Lyrics and Other Poems in 1866, and is one of the people attributed with writing the lyrics for the song ""John Brown's Body."" He also wrote two popular histories for subscription publishers: The People's Book of Ancient and Modern History in 1851, and The Discoverers, Pioneers, and Settlers of North and South America in 1853. He developed cancer of the face, and underwent surgery in Boston, resulting in the removal of only part of the tumor. His last few years were painful. He made a trip to Florida with his brother Ned (Edward) in 1871-72 where they felt the warmer climate might make Henry more comfortable. At his death, the poet Thomas Bailey Aldrich eulogized him in a short poem, (“Henry Howard Brownell,” Atlantic Monthly, May 1873).; Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), the third child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a landscape artist. He spent seven consecutive winters in Cuba (1854-1861), traveled extensively throughout Europe (1871-1877), to Egypt in 1877, the Caribbean in 1888, and Jamaica in 1894, as well as to various parts of the U.S. Although trained as a lawyer, like his brother Henry, he soon decided against a law career. He took various jobs in Liberty, Virginia, from 1848-1849, and Alexandria, Louisiana, in 1850, and authored a book, The Indian Races of America in 1850, before deciding to concentrate on his painting. He studied with Julius Busch and Joseph Ropes in Hartford. His first works were exhibited at the Hartford Agricultural Society County fair in 1855, and he set up a studio in Hartford in 1857 -1858. In 1860, he moved to New York City and submitted work for sale at the National Academy of Design there in 1861-1862. He married Henrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) after her divorce from Dr. George A. Pierce in 1865 (see biography of Henrietta Knowlton Angell below). When not traveling abroad, they lived in Bristol, Rhode Island, with their four sons: Carl DeWolf Brownell born 1866, Ernest Henry Brownell born 1867, G. Edward Ibarra Brownell born 1870, and Roger Williams Brownell born 1876. His step daughter, Esther Pierce (b. 1860), sometimes lived with the family. His most well-known painting is ""The Connecticut Charter Oak.”; 	Edward Rogerson Brownell [Ned] (1825-1889), the fifth child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a physician like his father. He attended medical school in New Orleans, and was made a visiting physician at the Charity Hospital there while still a student. He took his diploma exam in 1850, and moved to rural Plaisance, Louisiana, where he married Pamela Laysard (b. in 1838, daughter of Malafret Laysard) in 1853. Edward tried to combine his medical practice in rural Louisiana with raising cotton, but had little success in the cotton business. He and Pamela had six children before they became embroiled in a bitter separation. The oldest child, Francis (b. 1854), came back East with his father prior to 1866, and in the 1880 Census was living with a great aunt in Hartford, Connecticut. The other four living children (Lucia b. 1857, Arthur b. 1859, Clarence b. 1860, and Charles b. 1862) stayed in Louisiana with their mother. The 1910 Census lists Pamela L. Brownell as living in Rapides County, Louisiana, at age 70, with only one of her six children still alive. Edward [Ned] spent the years after his marital separation living with his mother in Bristol, Rhode Island, and is listed in the 1880 Census as an ""alopathic physician"".; 	Clarence Melville Brownell, the youngest child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was born May 2, 1828, in East Harford, Connecticut, and died in May 1862, on the White Nile River in Central Africa [Lat. 8 N.] at the age of 34. He never married. Despite being trained as a physician and having built up a thriving medical practice in East Hartford (1853-1859), he had a strong desire to travel to remote areas. In November 1859, he left for Callao, Peru, and made a trip down the Amazon. In 1860, he traveled to St. Thomas and Cuba. In 1861 he visited his brother Ned in rural Cloutierville, Louisiana, and then left for Alexandria, Egypt, via Marseille, expecting to be gone two years. In late October a letter was forwarded to him in Marseille offering him a captaincy in a Connecticut Regiment, which he had been most eager to have. But, because he had already begun his trip to Egypt, he decided to go on. In Khartoum he met John Pethernick and joined his expedition to the source of the White Nile, agreeing to make botanical collections for them. Brownell kept a diary from January 1, 1862, to May 13, 1862 [typescript at the University of Durham, England], describing his travels, as well as the flora and fauna he encountered. The diary ended about a week before his death when he became too ill to write. John Pethernick's wife wrote an account of his death in Travels in Central Africa, published in 1869 in London.; 	Henrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) was the daughter of Henry Angell and Rebecca Knowlton of Rhode Island. She married Dr. George A. Pierce in February 1859. They had two children, Esther H. Pierce (b. 1860) and Henry A. Pierce (1863-1867), before divorcing. In 1865, Henrietta married the artist Charles DeWolf Brownell, by whom she had four sons: Carl D. Brownell, b. 1866; Ernest Henry Brownell, b. 1867; G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell, b.1870; and Roger Williams Brownell, b. 1876. She and the children accompanied Charles to Europe in the 1870s. At some point she converted to Catholicism, and published two long stories in serial form in the journal Catholic World. One was called Donna Quixote (1882) and the other Out of the West (1883). She also wrote God's Way, Man's Way - A History of Bristol, Rhode Island, and submitted articles to the Phoenix. It was at her request and with her financial support that four Sisters of Mercy from Providence, Rhode Island, were sent across to Newfoundland's west coast to found the first Sisters of Mercy house there in 1893.; Henritetta Knowlton Angell and Charles DeWolf Brownell's son Ernest Henry Brownell was born in 1867. He graduated from Brown University in 1888 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890. He was an instructor in civil engineering at Brown University in the 1890s. Beginning in 1902, he served as an officer in the United States Navy Civil Engineer Corps, holding positions at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; New York, New York; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Florida; and Washington, D.C. In 1891 he married Annie May Angell (1866-1958). Together they had four children: John Angell Brownell (1892-1977), Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982), Margaret Knowlton Brownell (1895-1977), and Thomas Church Brownell (1898-1953). He died in 1945 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island.; Annie May Angell Brownell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1866 to John Arnold Angell (1837-1877) and Annie Wardwell Usher Angell (1840-1898). Her siblings included Bertha Angell (1868-1928), John Wardwell Angell (1870-1927), and Elsie Angell (1875-1877). Her paternal grandparents were John Angell (b. 1794) and Nancy Arnold Angell (1798-1876). From 1910 to 1940, she is listed in the United States Federal Censuses as a patient in the Butler Hospital for the Insane. She died in 1958 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island.; Bertha Angell, born in 1868, was Annie May Angell Brownell's sister. In 1902 she married Lewis Howe Kalloch (b. 1867), a dentist, and in 1904 she gave birth to Lewis Howe Kalloch, Jr. They appear to have been involved in business with Ernest and Annie May Brownell. She died in 1928.; Annie May Angell Brownell and Ernest Henry Brownell's daughter Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982) graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. She married Clifford Kyler Rathbone (1893-1944) in 1923. Clifford's parents were John K. Rathbone and Myrtle Petty Rathbone of Denton, Texas. Clifford Rathbone worked in construction, listed as a contractor in the 1930 United States Federal Census and an architectural engineer in 1940. He had at least one sibling, Rosalie Rathbone (1891-1976), who married William A. Craft (1894-1963) in 1950. Both Rosalie and William Craft taught at Iowa State. ; Together Dorothea and Clifford Rathbone had two children, Dorinda Rathbone (1924-2009) and Henry Brownell Rathbone (1925-1951). Dorinda Rathbone attended the University of Washington and married Carlos Dew, Jr., in 1946. Henry Rathbone graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. He was killed during the Korean War while serving in the United States Navy.; Other figures in the collection are noted below. ; 	Procer Wright was probably an Englishman.  He seems to have met Charles and Henrietta Brownell in San Raphael, France, in 1876.  He and Henrietta Brownell became friends and corresponded between 1876 and 1884, when Wright was traveling through Europe. ; 	Don Manuel Ibarra was a Spaniard married to a Cuban woman.  He worked at the San Martin sugar refinery (""ingenio"") near Cardenas, Cuba.  He was probably the refinery manager, but could have been a partial owner.  He worked in Cuba from 1855-1870, returning to Barcelona, Spain, by 1871, perhaps because of the unrest caused by the Cuban ""Ten-Year War"" which started in October of 1868 and involved bloody clashes between Cuban independence seekers and Spanish troops.  Ibarra met Charles Brownell in Cuba. They became such close friends that Brownell named his third son born in 1870, after Ibarra (G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell).; 	Lucy Larcom (1824-1893) was a poet, author and editor.  She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Larcom and Lois Barrett.  After her father's death, the family moved to Lowell, where her mother kept a boarding house, and Lucy worked in the mills for ten years.  Through a literary club at the mills, she met John G. Whittier who encouraged her to write.  She accompanied a married sister to Illinois where she taught school for three years before attending Monticello Female Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, for three years.  She returned to Beverly, Massachusetts, and taught for six years at Wheaton Female Seminary, where she met Henrietta Angell [Brownell]. When her health began to fail, she resigned and took a position editing the children's magazine Our Young Folks.  She continued to write and publish her own poetry and prose.  She never married.; 	Henrietta Silliman Dana (1823-1907) was the daughter of Benjamin Silliman, a professor at Yale, and Harriet Trumbell.  In 1844, she married James Dwight Dana who became a renown professor of geology at Yale.  He accompanied the Charles Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific in the early 1840's, and then became Silliman Professor of Natural History and Geology at Yale until several years before he died in 1895.  He wrote classical works on geology and mineralogy.  The Danas had six children, but lost two of them to diphtheria in 1861.  Their son, Edward (b. 1849), also became a professor at Yale."

Together they had four children: John Angell Brownell (1892-1977), Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982), Margaret Knowlton Brownell (1895-1977), and Thomas Church Brownell (1898-1953). He died in 1945 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island.; Annie May Angell Brownell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1866 to John Arnold Angell (1837-1877) and Annie Wardwell Usher Angell (1840-1898). Her siblings included Bertha Angell (1868-1928), John Wardwell Angell (1870-1927), and Elsie Angell (1875-1877). Her paternal grandparents were John Angell (b. 1794) and Nancy Arnold Angell (1798-1876). From 1910 to 1940, she is listed in the United States Federal Censuses as a patient in the Butler Hospital for the Insane. She died in 1958 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island.; Bertha Angell, born in 1868, was Annie May Angell Brownell's sister. In 1902 she married Lewis Howe Kalloch (b. 1867), a dentist, and in 1904 she gave birth to Lewis Howe Kalloch, Jr. They appear to have been involved in business with Ernest and Annie May Brownell. She died in 1928.; Annie May Angell Brownell and Ernest Henry Brownell's daughter Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982) graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. She married Clifford Kyler Rathbone (1893-1944) in 1923. Clifford's parents were John K. Rathbone and Myrtle Petty Rathbone of Denton, Texas. Clifford Rathbone worked in construction, listed as a contractor in the 1930 United States Federal Census and an architectural engineer in 1940. He had at least one sibling, Rosalie Rathbone (1891-1976), who married William A. Craft (1894-1963) in 1950. Both Rosalie and William Craft taught at Iowa State. ; Together Dorothea and Clifford Rathbone had two children, Dorinda Rathbone (1924-2009) and Henry Brownell Rathbone (1925-1951). Dorinda Rathbone attended the University of Washington and married Carlos Dew, Jr., in 1946. Henry Rathbone graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. He was killed during the Korean War while serving in the United States Navy.; Other figures in the collection are noted below. ; 	Procer Wright was probably an Englishman.  He seems to have met Charles and Henrietta Brownell in San Raphael, France, in 1876.  He and Henrietta Brownell became friends and corresponded between 1876 and 1884, when Wright was traveling through Europe. ; 	Don Manuel Ibarra was a Spaniard married to a Cuban woman.  He worked at the San Martin sugar refinery (""ingenio"") near Cardenas, Cuba.  He was probably the refinery manager, but could have been a partial owner.  He worked in Cuba from 1855-1870, returning to Barcelona, Spain, by 1871, perhaps because of the unrest caused by the Cuban ""Ten-Year War"" which started in October of 1868 and involved bloody clashes between Cuban independence seekers and Spanish troops.  Ibarra met Charles Brownell in Cuba. They became such close friends that Brownell named his third son born in 1870, after Ibarra (G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell).; 	Lucy Larcom (1824-1893) was a poet, author and editor.  She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Larcom and Lois Barrett.  After her father's death, the family moved to Lowell, where her mother kept a boarding house, and Lucy worked in the mills for ten years.  Through a literary club at the mills, she met John G. Whittier who encouraged her to write.  She accompanied a married sister to Illinois where she taught school for three years before attending Monticello Female Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, for three years.  She returned to Beverly, Massachusetts, and taught for six years at Wheaton Female Seminary, where she met Henrietta Angell [Brownell]. When her health began to fail, she resigned and took a position editing the children's magazine Our Young Folks.  She continued to write and publish her own poetry and prose.  She never married.; 	Henrietta Silliman Dana (1823-1907) was the daughter of Benjamin Silliman, a professor at Yale, and Harriet Trumbell.  In 1844, she married James Dwight Dana who became a renown professor of geology at Yale.  He accompanied the Charles Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific in the early 1840's, and then became Silliman Professor of Natural History and Geology at Yale until several years before he died in 1895.  He wrote classical works on geology and mineralogy.  The Danas had six children, but lost two of them to diphtheria in 1861.  Their son, Edward (b. 1849), also became a professor at Yale."

Davis Papers,Race,1,bioghist,"Cushman Kellogg Davis relocated with his family from New York state to Waukesha, Wisc., as a young boy. After graduation from the University of Michigan in 1857 he studied law and opened a practice in his home town. Commissioned first lieutenant in the 28th Wisconsin Infantry in 1862, Davis's Civil War career included service as judge-advocate and adjutant-general on the staff of Gen. Willis Gorman. In 1864 he returned to Wisconsin, married, and relocated to St. Paul, Minn., to join his former commanding officer in law practice. ; Davis's political career began with 1867 election to the state legislature, and he subsequently served as United States district attorney from 1868 to 1873. Though a Republican, Davis supported the Granger movement, speaking out against business abuses by the railroads, and gaining a reputation that won him the governor's seat in 1873 due to his influence over the Granger vote. Losing a bid for U.S. Senator in 1875, he settled back into legal work until 1887, when a successful Senate race resurrected his political career. Davis served in the Senate, keeping a law practice on the side, for the rest of his life. ; As a Senator he concentrated on committee work and focused primarily on pensions and foreign relations. He went to Paris as a peace commissioner following the Spanish American War, and used the position to advance American expansionism. Although his early political career had been characterized by anti-monopoly and pro-agriculture sentiments, Davis came to espouse the basic ideals of the Republican party, though moderated by a sympathy for farmers in his agricultural state. He was an ardent imperialist, an advocate of strict law and order in the face of labor unrest, and a tariff advocate. An early marriage, to Laura Bowman of Waukesha, ended in divorce, and in 1880 Davis married Anna Malcolm Agnew of St. Paul. They had no children."

His single letter to Marjorie Ferrara congratulates her on the birth of her daughter (December 5, 1943).; Santo Ferrara's other correspondents included Paul Feldman Cox, who served with a navy demolition unit, and Corporal Tony Pirrone of the Army's 806th Tank Destroyer Battalion.  Cox complained about his training at Camp Peary, Virginia, and described his work after a transfer to the Marine Corps unit; he was reassigned to Fort Pierce, Florida, in January 1944, where he became an instructor after his unit shipped out in late February.  Pirrone discussed his experiences at Camp Rucker, Alabama; commented on his health; and shared his plans to get married after the end of the war.  Ferrara also received a V-mail letter from James E. O'Toole, a member of Seabee Detachment 1040, about O'Toole's time in North Africa ([February] 12, 1944).; After the end of hostilities, Henry and Billy Ferrara wrote to their brother Santo about the possibility of being discharged under the military's point system.

38,umich-wcl-M-3391fol,foley_final.xml,Finding Aid for Mary Alice Foley Papers,Enemy,1,bioghist,"Mary Alice Foley, born in 1925, was the only child of Frank Gerald Foley and Ella Delores McTeague. Frank and Ella married in 1923. Frank worked for a firm in America that sent him to the Philippines on business in mid-1937. Mary Alice and her mother stayed in New York, where the family lived, until October 1937, when they embarked on a sea voyage to join Frank in Manila. They left Brooklyn on October 14, 1937, passed through the Panama Canal, and arrived in Manila on November 25. They lived in an apartment hotel in Manila. Mary Alice began school in 1938 at Maryknoll Normal School, a Catholic school. Her mother entertained herself with cocktails, shopping, and watching movies, while her father continued to work for the American firm, but considered switching jobs to a company based in the Philippines. On May 23, 1938, the family left Manila to sail back to New York, stopping in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Japan on the way. ; Frank apparently lost his job after the family returned to America, because the firm went bankrupt. He decided to take the job in Manila, dealing in sugar and coconut oil, and the family returned to the Philippines before 1940. Mary Alice went to school at the American School in Manila. She was a freshman during the 1939-40 school year. When war in the Pacific broke out, the United States told civilian families they would be safe in Manila, so Mary Alice and her family remained there. On December 9, 1942, the Japanese attacked the Philippines, and by January 2, 1943, the Japanese occupied Manila. On that day, they sent the civilians of enemy countries into an internment camp at the University of Santo Tomas. Mary Alice and her family remained there until they were liberated by allied forces on February 3, 1945. ; Internees in the camp lost their freedom and privacy, but food and other provisions were adequate for most of the camp's existence: not until mid-1944 did the food supply grow scarce, causing some people to die of malnutrition. The internees slept in large, sex-segregated dormitories, with 40 to 50 people in a room. They were given some autonomy in the camp, created classes for school children and college students, published an internment newspaper, and occasionally put on plays or talent shows. Mary Alice continued her high school studies while interned, and graduated from high school on April 30, 1943. She began college classes after graduation. ; The family was on their way home by April 3, 1945, and resumed life in New York, staying with Ella's sister, Irene McTeague. Mary Alice later moved to Long Island, and, near the end of her life, Scarborough, New York. Mary Alice never forgot the time spent in the internment camp, and she attended the fortieth and fiftieth reunions of the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. At the fiftieth reunion, she gave a speech. Mary Alice died in 1996, at the age of 71. "
39,umich-wcl-M-3391fol,foley_final.xml,Finding Aid for Mary Alice Foley Papers,Native,1,scopecontent,"The collection contains a wide variety of items from before, during, and after the Foley family's internment. Ella Foley's journal, 213 photographs of Mary Alice, family, and her friends, school girl letters, manuscripts and publications created and received while in the camp, and materials created for internee reunions are all present. A number of loving cups from the Polo Club in Manila and several publications have been transferred to the Graphics and Book Divisions, respectively. ; Chronologically, the first item is a diary Ella Foley kept from October 13, 1937 to July 8, 1938, covering the family's first stay in Manila. She began the diary the day before she and Mary Alice left New York to join Frank in Manila, so the first two months give an detailed description of the sea voyage, including an interesting description of the Panama Canal (1937 October 22). Many of the photographs with the collection are pictures from the various places the Foleys visited while traveling to and from Manila, including the Panama Canal, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Japan. ; The diary describes what life was like for Ella during her husband's first journey to Manila. Ella was not happy in the Philippines and hoped that her husband would not accept a permanent job there. ""Manila would be a terrible future home,"" she wrote in her diary on 1838 January 6. Ella did not have much to do, especially since the hotel staff took care of their apartment. She made friends with some other American couples living in the Philippines, such as Mae and Jerry Sheehan, possibly related to John Sheehan, a priest who was interned with the Foleys during the war. Ella interacted very little with native Filipinos. She kept herself busy by seeing a movie nearly everyday, shopping, going to the polo club, drinking cocktails (she was especially fond of ""White Ladies""), and even gambling. ; Ella was a devout Catholic, despite her gambling, and went to church every Sunday, and celebrated all the holidays. On Good Friday, she went to go see the ""Flagellantes,"" although she was somewhat skeptical: ""It looked like blood on his back but it might have been red paint"" (1938 April 15). Ella hardly mentioned anything about Japanese aggression, only noting that Japan had bombed the American gunboat ""Panay"" (1937 December 13). On her way back from Manila in 1938, she even stopped in Japan, as well as Hong Kong and Shanghai. ; Of the letters in the collection, ten of them were sent to Mary Alice by various schoolmates during the Foleys' second stay in Manila. During 1940-41, Mary Alice was pleased with her school and had an active social life, spending time with her friends at the Polo Club. Many of the pictures in her scrapbook and additional pictures were taken by her and her friends at the Polo club. Mary Alice and her pals were particularly interested in boys, and spent paragraphs discussing the behavior of boys in their class and parties they attended. ; Mary Alice's sheltered teenage world was dramatically changed with internment. Items from the internment camp include: school work and a report card, showing Mary Alice's graduation from high school; 3 birthday and Christmas cards; a small diary kept by Mary Alice from April 22 to May 26, 1944; ""Our Time,"" a satirical play of internment life, broadcast over the PA system in 1942; the September 1942 issue of ""The Internitis,"" a newspaper published by internees; worksheets for Spanish verbs; an internment baseball program; a listing of camp rules from 1942; and a transcription of a speech made for her high school graduation. ; Also from that time period are seven letters from the War Department to her mother's sister Irene McTeague and father's brother Joseph H. Foley; three camp form-letter postcards that Mary Alice and her mother sent to people in the United States; and an article about the camp from Life, September 7, 1942. Mary Alice later compiled the letters, the postcards, some photographs, the camp rules of 1942, and a brochure showing pictures of Santo Tomas into a scrapbook. ; The play, ""Our Time,"" (of which Mary Alice contributed the lyrics to one song) and ""The Internitis"" reveal the internees' life and their methods of coping with their loss of freedom and uncertainty in the future. The Japanese did not seem to censor the publications too strictly, so ""Our Time"" satirized life in camp through comments like, ""Why clean any [more rooms]? We'll only be here for 3 days,"" and ""that Venetian blind is a lot softer than this concrete to sleep on"" (""Our Time,"" page 1). ""The Internitis"" has stories and articles relating to camp life, and reveals the wearing nature of being interned as well as the internees' efforts to create a normal life by building shanties for privacy and exchanging recipes. ; The Christmas and birthday cards to Mary Alice and her mother try to be full of optimism and hope, with sentiments such as, ""May this xmas be a nice one / Even though you are in here"" (Betsy McRea, n.d.). Mary Alice, as recorded in her diary, kept herself busy by working at internment camp jobs, playing baseball, and taking college courses in ""Economics, English Lit. & Psychology"" (1944 May 25). She also recorded her weight in 1944, and noted how it had dwindled from 164 pounds on May 1, 1944 to 124 pounds on January 1, 1945. ; The post-internment materials in the collection include a letter to Mary Alice from Rev. John Sheehan, who was also interned in Santo Tomas and in 1945 was touring the country speaking about his experiences. Finally, the collection contains photographs from the fortieth and fiftieth reunions of the Santo Tomas Internment Camp and a transcription of the speech given by Mary Alice at the fiftieth reunion. The speech gives some additional details of life in the camp. "

First joining the ranks of the New York National Guard, 7th Regiment, Company D, on September 29th 1891, Townsend was elected Lance-Corporal on November 6th 1893 and Corporal on December 20th 1894.  He was honorably discharged on July 22nd 1898.; During the Spanish American War, the 7th NYNG faced controversy for voting unanimously against allowing members to individually enlist in the US Army, as this would have effectively disbanded the unit.  However, New York Governor Frank S. Black (1853-1913) refused the 7th NYNG's various proposals for service that would have allowed the regiment to remain intact.  Townsend desperately wanted to serve his country and was eventually allowed to join Company M of the 201st Infantry Regiment of New York Volunteers as a Captain in July of 1898 after receiving sterling recommendations from commanding officers including Captain Willard C. Fisk (1856-1927) and Colonel Daniel Appleton (1852-1929).  On April 10th 1899, Townsend was appointed a Second Lieutenant in the regular army and received his first assignment a month later with the 1st Infantry Regiment, Company K, stationed at Pinar del Rio and Guanajay, Cuba.  Townsend's mother Emma also appears to have traveled to Cuba as she is identified in select photographs as ""Mrs. Townsend.""; At the outset of the Philippine-American War, the 1st Infantry were ordered to head for Manila.  After a brief stay at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the regiment arrived in San Francisco in late August, 1900, before setting sail for the Philippines.  While in the Philippines, Townsend was primarily deployed in the Eastern Visayas and was for a time the Inspector of Customs at Guiuan, Samar.  During an engagement near Laoang, Samar, Townsend himself survived an ambush in which he was stabbed in the arm.  His detachment also narrowly avoided being sent to Balangiga, where 54 American soldiers were killed in the infamous Balangiga Massacre on September 28th 1901.; After his first tour of active duty in the Philippines, Townsend was stationed for a time at Fort Brady in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, in the Department of the Lakes.  However, he and the 1st Infantry were once again sent to the Philippines in January of 1906 and stationed at Camp Stotsenburg, where Townsend was detailed as Aide-de-Camp to Brigadier Generals Walter T. Duggan (1843-1915) and Albert Leopold Mills (1854-1916).  Townsend was subsequently promoted to 1st Lieutenant and later made Captain of Company H of the 23rd Infantry before being reassigned to the 1st Infantry in 1910.; Townsend graduated from the Army School of the Line and the Army Staff College in Fort Leavenworth in 1909 and 1910 respectively.  Sometime following his graduation, Townsend was promoted to Lt. Colonel before being appointed to an administrative position at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland.  He married Kathryn McCombs (1879-1973) in Manhattan on December 9th 1916.  In 1923, Townsend was appointed Commandant of Cadets at Ohio State University, a position he held until his retirement from the US Army in 1938.  He had attained the rank of Colonel by the time of his retirement.  Townsend passed away on January 6th 1956 in St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 82.; Townsend's written works include the Manual of the Bayonet: United States Army, which he co-authored with Herschel Tupes in 1913."

Townsend's mother Emma also appears to have traveled to Cuba as she is identified in select photographs as ""Mrs. Townsend.""; At the outset of the Philippine-American War, the 1st Infantry were ordered to head for Manila.  After a brief stay at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the regiment arrived in San Francisco in late August, 1900, before setting sail for the Philippines.  While in the Philippines, Townsend was primarily deployed in the Eastern Visayas and was for a time the Inspector of Customs at Guiuan, Samar.  During an engagement near Laoang, Samar, Townsend himself survived an ambush in which he was stabbed in the arm.  His detachment also narrowly avoided being sent to Balangiga, where 54 American soldiers were killed in the infamous Balangiga Massacre on September 28th 1901.; After his first tour of active duty in the Philippines, Townsend was stationed for a time at Fort Brady in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, in the Department of the Lakes.  However, he and the 1st Infantry were once again sent to the Philippines in January of 1906 and stationed at Camp Stotsenburg, where Townsend was detailed as Aide-de-Camp to Brigadier Generals Walter T. Duggan (1843-1915) and Albert Leopold Mills (1854-1916).  Townsend was subsequently promoted to 1st Lieutenant and later made Captain of Company H of the 23rd Infantry before being reassigned to the 1st Infantry in 1910.; Townsend graduated from the Army School of the Line and the Army Staff College in Fort Leavenworth in 1909 and 1910 respectively.  Sometime following his graduation, Townsend was promoted to Lt. Colonel before being appointed to an administrative position at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland.  He married Kathryn McCombs (1879-1973) in Manhattan on December 9th 1916.  In 1923, Townsend was appointed Commandant of Cadets at Ohio State University, a position he held until his retirement from the US Army in 1938.  He had attained the rank of Colonel by the time of his retirement.  Townsend passed away on January 6th 1956 in St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 82.; Townsend's written works include the Manual of the Bayonet: United States Army, which he co-authored with Herschel Tupes in 1913."

57,umich-wcl-M-2264.3hus,hussey_final.xml,Finding Aid for Hussey-Wadsworth Family Papers,Cleanliness,1,scopecontent,"The Hussey-Wadsworth papers fall into two main categories, documenting the involvement of two well-to-do families in the Civil War, Spanish-American War and, less intensively, in the two World Wars. While military involvement forms the core of the collection, there is also interesting material relating to the social and educational lives of upper class New Yorkers, business affairs, and of particular note, the Reconstruction period in Georgia. The collection centers around three main figures: George Tuttle Hussey, his son, George Alexander Hussey, and Andrew S. Wadsworth. ; Highly educated and a gifted writer, George Alexander Hussey's letters are uniformly interesting and enjoyable. One of the most remarkable of his letters is a 61 page description of his tour through Bavaria and Switzerland, written in November, 1860. With room to spare, Hussey lavished attention on the sites in Munich, Zürich, and Dachsen, where he marveled at the waterfalls, and he was captivated by everything from the sublime mountains to a cheese maker's simple house, the Freiburg Bridge, and European power politics. Hussey's appreciation of the landscape, architecture and high culture, however, did not extend to the ""ignorant"" masses whom he observed groveling in prayer to a statue of the Virgin Mary. ; Shortly after returning from Europe, Hussey became a Union soldier and began relating his experiences to his father. A common complaint in his correspondence was his desire for a commission. Believing that influence and money purchased rank, Hussey told his father that both were necessary if he wished to become a first lieutenant and then a captain, and when his father did not respond with the alacrity which Hussey felt due, he scolded him. The delay, he insisted, had cost him one hundred dollars (67). Ambitious, young Hussey did finally achieve the rank of captain. He was discharged in November, 1863, reenlisted the following May, and again, almost immediately began his pursuit of a commission, this time, though, through the help of his friends rather than his father (81). ; Tensions between George Alexander Hussey and his father extended deeper than the simple matter of assistance in obtaining a commission. The animosity may have stemmed from the length of time it took the younger Hussey to repay a debt he had incurred during his European tour. In December 1860, George IV borrowed forty dollars from K. Grossgebauer, a resident of Gotha, Germany (47, 53). George III apparently accused his son of lying about the debt, and in response, George IV complained that his father treated him like a child (53). By May, 1864, Private Hussey had paid off the debt, but the ill feelings continued to grow (80). As a result, he began directing his letters to his mother and sister. ; George Alexander's letters also reflect some of the problems facing Union officers. In June, 1862, he wrote that ten officers of the 83rd Regiment had resigned in two months and that many more would have done the same had their resignations been accepted. Apparently, the officers did not get along well with the regiment's colonel, who was said to be ""a perfect idol of gold and silver"" (37). In March, 1863, eight more officers tendered their resignations, followed by seven more in June. This tumult in the officers' ranks was matched by ill discipline, and arrests were not uncommon. In July, 1863, for example, eight officers were under arrest, and in July, 1865, after some ""unknown"" soldiers ""played a Yankee trick"" on a general at Morris Island, the entire 165th Regiment was disarmed and sent as prisoners to Fort Sumter. Even the officers were placed under arrest, though according to Hussey, they had done nothing wrong (121). ; Although the 165th Regiment was said to have a good reputation, in Hussey's opinion, it was a poor organization. While traveling on the Victor, the soldiers threw food valued at $1,000 overboard, some men were known thieves while in the service, and more than one hundred of the regiment's soldiers served time in correctional institutions, with about the same number listed as deserters (85). While at Hart's Island, two soldiers even tried to escape in a general's boat (80). ; In addition to a fine description of the activities of the 165th Regiment, the Hussey-Wadsworth Papers includes a number of references to white opinions of African American civilians and soldiers and the general rise in racial tensions during early Reconstruction. In June, 1865, for example, Hussey reported that Black civilians were in control of the South Carolina rice plantations and he was impressed with their industriousness. Nevertheless, Black and white soldiers were involved in a number of altercations in Charleston, including one particularly violent incident in which African Americans were accused of using brickbats on the whites (121). Some white soldiers who refused to mount guard with Black soldiers were imprisoned at Fort Pulaski (121). ; When not fighting or quarreling with each other, the Union soldiers spent some of their time battling Confederates. Hussey's letters include accounts of several skirmishes, most notably of the Siege of Suffolk in May, 1863, which left forty Union privates and four officers wounded, including Hussey (61). Among Hussey's other duties was escorting Confederate prisoners to camps and forts. In September, 1864, he accompanied 150 prisoners to Camp Chase, Ohio. Along the way, Confederate sympathizers tried to give the prisoners money, food, and clothing (92), and given the strength of this sentiment, it is not surprising that a month later, when leading 200 Confederate officers to Fort Delaware, Hussey wrote that they were all ""secessionists to the backbone"" (93). ; During the presidential election in 1864, Hussey appears to have been in the minority of his regiment in supporting Lincoln. Four-fifths of the 165th Regiment, he wrote, favored McClellan (94), though all of the soldiers of the 165th mourned the president's death (112). ; Andrew S. Wadsworth's letters also provide valuable documentation of military experience, focused on the period of the American intervention in the Philippines. His letters provide several accounts of skirmishes with Filipino insurgents, including a vivid description of the skirmish in which he was wounded and a quartermaster sergeant was killed.  The letters are equally important in documenting an average soldier's attitudes toward the enemy in one of America's first imperial wars. Wadsworth had few kind words for the insurgents, whom he frequently referred to by racial epithets, and commented not only on their primitive weapons -- mostly bows, arrows and shields, but also on their tactics. By Wadsworth's reckoning, the insurgents battled American soldiers two or three times a week, and were known to jump out of trees in ambush (173). ; In other letters, Wadsworth turned his eye to the battered Spanish gunboats in Manila Bay (158), the American victory at Manila (160), Filipino civilians (158, 159, 160), and Chinese laborers engaged in the novelty trade (160, 161), and whom the Filipinos hated (161). Referring to Manila, Andrew wrote that it was ""behind the times,"" but that it had the finest electric lighting he had ever seen. He asserted, however, that the Filipinos were not concerned with cleanliness: people suffering from either smallpox or leprosy walked the streets of Cavite openly, and Filipino civilians removed the clothes of dead Spanish soldiers and resold them. Andrew himself bought a pair of pants and a shirt. ; The Hussey-Wadsworth Papers also provide a brief but interesting description of trenches and bombing during the First World War (210), and there is brief commentary on censorship, the German retreat, and the determination of American soldiers (208, 210). One letter refers to the bombing of London during Word War II (232) and to war rationing in both the United States and Great Britain (231, 232). ; According to Mekeel's Weekly Stamp News, George Tuttle Hussey sold stamps to collectors and issued bronze pennies. Examples of these stamps and coins, dated 1863, are housed in the Postal History Collection. "

While at Hart's Island, two soldiers even tried to escape in a general's boat (80). ; In addition to a fine description of the activities of the 165th Regiment, the Hussey-Wadsworth Papers includes a number of references to white opinions of African American civilians and soldiers and the general rise in racial tensions during early Reconstruction. In June, 1865, for example, Hussey reported that Black civilians were in control of the South Carolina rice plantations and he was impressed with their industriousness. Nevertheless, Black and white soldiers were involved in a number of altercations in Charleston, including one particularly violent incident in which African Americans were accused of using brickbats on the whites (121). Some white soldiers who refused to mount guard with Black soldiers were imprisoned at Fort Pulaski (121). ; When not fighting or quarreling with each other, the Union soldiers spent some of their time battling Confederates. Hussey's letters include accounts of several skirmishes, most notably of the Siege of Suffolk in May, 1863, which left forty Union privates and four officers wounded, including Hussey (61). Among Hussey's other duties was escorting Confederate prisoners to camps and forts. In September, 1864, he accompanied 150 prisoners to Camp Chase, Ohio. Along the way, Confederate sympathizers tried to give the prisoners money, food, and clothing (92), and given the strength of this sentiment, it is not surprising that a month later, when leading 200 Confederate officers to Fort Delaware, Hussey wrote that they were all ""secessionists to the backbone"" (93). ; During the presidential election in 1864, Hussey appears to have been in the minority of his regiment in supporting Lincoln. Four-fifths of the 165th Regiment, he wrote, favored McClellan (94), though all of the soldiers of the 165th mourned the president's death (112). ; Andrew S. Wadsworth's letters also provide valuable documentation of military experience, focused on the period of the American intervention in the Philippines. His letters provide several accounts of skirmishes with Filipino insurgents, including a vivid description of the skirmish in which he was wounded and a quartermaster sergeant was killed.  The letters are equally important in documenting an average soldier's attitudes toward the enemy in one of America's first imperial wars. Wadsworth had few kind words for the insurgents, whom he frequently referred to by racial epithets, and commented not only on their primitive weapons -- mostly bows, arrows and shields, but also on their tactics. By Wadsworth's reckoning, the insurgents battled American soldiers two or three times a week, and were known to jump out of trees in ambush (173). ; In other letters, Wadsworth turned his eye to the battered Spanish gunboats in Manila Bay (158), the American victory at Manila (160), Filipino civilians (158, 159, 160), and Chinese laborers engaged in the novelty trade (160, 161), and whom the Filipinos hated (161). Referring to Manila, Andrew wrote that it was ""behind the times,"" but that it had the finest electric lighting he had ever seen. He asserted, however, that the Filipinos were not concerned with cleanliness: people suffering from either smallpox or leprosy walked the streets of Cavite openly, and Filipino civilians removed the clothes of dead Spanish soldiers and resold them. Andrew himself bought a pair of pants and a shirt. ; The Hussey-Wadsworth Papers also provide a brief but interesting description of trenches and bombing during the First World War (210), and there is brief commentary on censorship, the German retreat, and the determination of American soldiers (208, 210). One letter refers to the bombing of London during Word War II (232) and to war rationing in both the United States and Great Britain (231, 232). ; According to Mekeel's Weekly Stamp News, George Tuttle Hussey sold stamps to collectors and issued bronze pennies.

59,umich-wcl-M-2264.3hus,hussey_final.xml,Finding Aid for Hussey-Wadsworth Family Papers,Insurgents,3,scopecontent,"The Hussey-Wadsworth papers fall into two main categories, documenting the involvement of two well-to-do families in the Civil War, Spanish-American War and, less intensively, in the two World Wars. While military involvement forms the core of the collection, there is also interesting material relating to the social and educational lives of upper class New Yorkers, business affairs, and of particular note, the Reconstruction period in Georgia. The collection centers around three main figures: George Tuttle Hussey, his son, George Alexander Hussey, and Andrew S. Wadsworth. ; Highly educated and a gifted writer, George Alexander Hussey's letters are uniformly interesting and enjoyable. One of the most remarkable of his letters is a 61 page description of his tour through Bavaria and Switzerland, written in November, 1860. With room to spare, Hussey lavished attention on the sites in Munich, Zürich, and Dachsen, where he marveled at the waterfalls, and he was captivated by everything from the sublime mountains to a cheese maker's simple house, the Freiburg Bridge, and European power politics. Hussey's appreciation of the landscape, architecture and high culture, however, did not extend to the ""ignorant"" masses whom he observed groveling in prayer to a statue of the Virgin Mary. ; Shortly after returning from Europe, Hussey became a Union soldier and began relating his experiences to his father. A common complaint in his correspondence was his desire for a commission. Believing that influence and money purchased rank, Hussey told his father that both were necessary if he wished to become a first lieutenant and then a captain, and when his father did not respond with the alacrity which Hussey felt due, he scolded him. The delay, he insisted, had cost him one hundred dollars (67). Ambitious, young Hussey did finally achieve the rank of captain. He was discharged in November, 1863, reenlisted the following May, and again, almost immediately began his pursuit of a commission, this time, though, through the help of his friends rather than his father (81). ; Tensions between George Alexander Hussey and his father extended deeper than the simple matter of assistance in obtaining a commission. The animosity may have stemmed from the length of time it took the younger Hussey to repay a debt he had incurred during his European tour. In December 1860, George IV borrowed forty dollars from K. Grossgebauer, a resident of Gotha, Germany (47, 53). George III apparently accused his son of lying about the debt, and in response, George IV complained that his father treated him like a child (53). By May, 1864, Private Hussey had paid off the debt, but the ill feelings continued to grow (80). As a result, he began directing his letters to his mother and sister. ; George Alexander's letters also reflect some of the problems facing Union officers. In June, 1862, he wrote that ten officers of the 83rd Regiment had resigned in two months and that many more would have done the same had their resignations been accepted. Apparently, the officers did not get along well with the regiment's colonel, who was said to be ""a perfect idol of gold and silver"" (37). In March, 1863, eight more officers tendered their resignations, followed by seven more in June. This tumult in the officers' ranks was matched by ill discipline, and arrests were not uncommon. In July, 1863, for example, eight officers were under arrest, and in July, 1865, after some ""unknown"" soldiers ""played a Yankee trick"" on a general at Morris Island, the entire 165th Regiment was disarmed and sent as prisoners to Fort Sumter. Even the officers were placed under arrest, though according to Hussey, they had done nothing wrong (121). ; Although the 165th Regiment was said to have a good reputation, in Hussey's opinion, it was a poor organization. While traveling on the Victor, the soldiers threw food valued at $1,000 overboard, some men were known thieves while in the service, and more than one hundred of the regiment's soldiers served time in correctional institutions, with about the same number listed as deserters (85).

When George Hussey's widow, Elisabeth Nichols Hussey, remarried to David Wheeler Tuttle, the step-father's surname was appended to the baby's as a middle name. Despite the resulting differences in names, the baby was routinely identified as ""George III"" and, in turn, his son George Alexander Hussey (1843-1929), was called ""George IV."" ; In 1836, at the age of twenty-four, George Tuttle Hussey embarked on what would become a thirty-five year career at the Bank of New York in New York City. On the side, he assisting in founding the Bank and Insurance City Post in September, 1854, which changed name four years later to Hussey's Instant Special Message Post. Hussey and his employees presented drafts, notes, and checks at banks for payment or certification, and the firm employed between 25 and 40 messengers, who delivered notes, packages, and bundles to Brooklyn, Jersey City, Yorkville, Harlem, Staten Island, and other places in the metropolitan area. Besides founding the Message Post, Hussey helped establish the Church of Atonement in Brooklyn. He died July 3, 1890, aged 78, and was survived by his wife, Mary Jane Alexander, and two children, Mary Hussey Blair and George Alexander Hussey. ; George Alexander Hussey was born December 23, 1843, in either Bergen, N.J., or New York City. As a young member of the economic elite of the city, Hussey took the de rigeur European tour at age seventeen, traveling across Switzerland and Bavaria, brushing up on his German and soaking up the local culture, but he had a rude awakening on returning home: political crisis. In July, 1861, three months after the Civil War began, Hussey enlisted as a private in Company I, 9th New York Militia Regiment (the New York City Guards), which was mustered into the federal service as the 83rd New York Infantry Regiment. During most of 1861, the 83rd Regiment was stationed in the ring of forts surrounding Washington, but late in the fall, they were reassigned to western Maryland and served for a time as the body guard for Gen. N.P. Banks. During the summer, they took part in the Shenandoah Campaign, and returned to the eastern part of the state, arriving to participate in the Bull Run campaign. ; During the 2nd Battle of Bull Run on August 30, 1862, Hussey was wounded in the chest and spent time recuperating in Philadelphia's National Guard Hospital. After recovering, he accepted a commission as first lieutenant in Co. I of the 103rd New York Infantry, formed in part from remnants of the 3rd German Rifles. The 103rd served primarily in southeastern Virginia, and were present at Suffolk during the siege, where on May 3, 1863, Hussey was wounded in action for a second time. Just under a month later, he was promoted to Captain of Co. E, and that November, he was discharged at the expiration of his two years' obligation. He returned to military life one final time, beginning May, 1864, as a member of New York's 165th Regiment, serving through the end of the war and receiving an honorable discharge in September, 1865. ; Returning to civilian life, George served as his father's secretary from September, 1865, to October, 1866, leaving that position for a job with the Merchants' Union Express Company. However when that company merged with the American Express Company in March, 1869, George was let go. Four months later, he landed with the Fourth National Bank of New York City, where he held a number of positions. While employed at the bank, he married Carrie Elisabeth St. John on November 25, 1875. Sixteen years later, George resigned as coupon collection clerk. According to a biography of the New York Volunteers of the 103rd Regiment, he later received a job with the Treasury Department. At the time of his death in 1929, he was a resident of Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. ; Andrew S. Wadsworth was the son of John Gilbert and Sarah Ashby Wadsworth. Born in New Lebanon, N.Y., on October 2, 1870, he enlisted in the 1st Nebraska Infantry on April 27, 1898, only a few days before Admiral George Dewey moved his fleet into Manila Bay. In July, Wadsworth and the 1st Nebraska Regiment arrived in the Philippines and commenced active campaigning. On April 23, 1899, while fighting Filipino insurgents, he was shot twice in the leg, and spent the next nine months as a convalescent in Manila and San Francisco hospitals. ; After returning to the States, Andrew spent much of his time trying to get his military pension increased, which, in 1901, was set at only fifteen dollars per month. It was twenty years before he saw any increase in his pension, which fluctuated wildly in value during the Depression before peaking in 1944, at a rate of sixty dollars per month. In the following year, approximately forty-six years after being wounded, he was awarded the Purple Heart. ; The Husseys are related to Andrew Wadsworth only through George T. Hussey's great-grandson, George William DeBell, who married Wadsworth's niece, Jean Wadsworth Hasbrouck."

63,umich-wcl-M-2264.3hus,hussey_final.xml,Finding Aid for Hussey-Wadsworth Family Papers,Death,1,scopecontent,"The Hussey-Wadsworth papers fall into two main categories, documenting the involvement of two well-to-do families in the Civil War, Spanish-American War and, less intensively, in the two World Wars. While military involvement forms the core of the collection, there is also interesting material relating to the social and educational lives of upper class New Yorkers, business affairs, and of particular note, the Reconstruction period in Georgia. The collection centers around three main figures: George Tuttle Hussey, his son, George Alexander Hussey, and Andrew S. Wadsworth. ; Highly educated and a gifted writer, George Alexander Hussey's letters are uniformly interesting and enjoyable. One of the most remarkable of his letters is a 61 page description of his tour through Bavaria and Switzerland, written in November, 1860. With room to spare, Hussey lavished attention on the sites in Munich, Zürich, and Dachsen, where he marveled at the waterfalls, and he was captivated by everything from the sublime mountains to a cheese maker's simple house, the Freiburg Bridge, and European power politics. Hussey's appreciation of the landscape, architecture and high culture, however, did not extend to the ""ignorant"" masses whom he observed groveling in prayer to a statue of the Virgin Mary. ; Shortly after returning from Europe, Hussey became a Union soldier and began relating his experiences to his father. A common complaint in his correspondence was his desire for a commission. Believing that influence and money purchased rank, Hussey told his father that both were necessary if he wished to become a first lieutenant and then a captain, and when his father did not respond with the alacrity which Hussey felt due, he scolded him. The delay, he insisted, had cost him one hundred dollars (67). Ambitious, young Hussey did finally achieve the rank of captain. He was discharged in November, 1863, reenlisted the following May, and again, almost immediately began his pursuit of a commission, this time, though, through the help of his friends rather than his father (81). ; Tensions between George Alexander Hussey and his father extended deeper than the simple matter of assistance in obtaining a commission. The animosity may have stemmed from the length of time it took the younger Hussey to repay a debt he had incurred during his European tour. In December 1860, George IV borrowed forty dollars from K. Grossgebauer, a resident of Gotha, Germany (47, 53). George III apparently accused his son of lying about the debt, and in response, George IV complained that his father treated him like a child (53). By May, 1864, Private Hussey had paid off the debt, but the ill feelings continued to grow (80). As a result, he began directing his letters to his mother and sister. ; George Alexander's letters also reflect some of the problems facing Union officers. In June, 1862, he wrote that ten officers of the 83rd Regiment had resigned in two months and that many more would have done the same had their resignations been accepted. Apparently, the officers did not get along well with the regiment's colonel, who was said to be ""a perfect idol of gold and silver"" (37). In March, 1863, eight more officers tendered their resignations, followed by seven more in June. This tumult in the officers' ranks was matched by ill discipline, and arrests were not uncommon. In July, 1863, for example, eight officers were under arrest, and in July, 1865, after some ""unknown"" soldiers ""played a Yankee trick"" on a general at Morris Island, the entire 165th Regiment was disarmed and sent as prisoners to Fort Sumter. Even the officers were placed under arrest, though according to Hussey, they had done nothing wrong (121). ; Although the 165th Regiment was said to have a good reputation, in Hussey's opinion, it was a poor organization. While traveling on the Victor, the soldiers threw food valued at $1,000 overboard, some men were known thieves while in the service, and more than one hundred of the regiment's soldiers served time in correctional institutions, with about the same number listed as deserters (85). While at Hart's Island, two soldiers even tried to escape in a general's boat (80). ; In addition to a fine description of the activities of the 165th Regiment, the Hussey-Wadsworth Papers includes a number of references to white opinions of African American civilians and soldiers and the general rise in racial tensions during early Reconstruction. In June, 1865, for example, Hussey reported that Black civilians were in control of the South Carolina rice plantations and he was impressed with their industriousness. Nevertheless, Black and white soldiers were involved in a number of altercations in Charleston, including one particularly violent incident in which African Americans were accused of using brickbats on the whites (121). Some white soldiers who refused to mount guard with Black soldiers were imprisoned at Fort Pulaski (121). ; When not fighting or quarreling with each other, the Union soldiers spent some of their time battling Confederates. Hussey's letters include accounts of several skirmishes, most notably of the Siege of Suffolk in May, 1863, which left forty Union privates and four officers wounded, including Hussey (61). Among Hussey's other duties was escorting Confederate prisoners to camps and forts. In September, 1864, he accompanied 150 prisoners to Camp Chase, Ohio. Along the way, Confederate sympathizers tried to give the prisoners money, food, and clothing (92), and given the strength of this sentiment, it is not surprising that a month later, when leading 200 Confederate officers to Fort Delaware, Hussey wrote that they were all ""secessionists to the backbone"" (93). ; During the presidential election in 1864, Hussey appears to have been in the minority of his regiment in supporting Lincoln. Four-fifths of the 165th Regiment, he wrote, favored McClellan (94), though all of the soldiers of the 165th mourned the president's death (112). ; Andrew S. Wadsworth's letters also provide valuable documentation of military experience, focused on the period of the American intervention in the Philippines. His letters provide several accounts of skirmishes with Filipino insurgents, including a vivid description of the skirmish in which he was wounded and a quartermaster sergeant was killed.  The letters are equally important in documenting an average soldier's attitudes toward the enemy in one of America's first imperial wars. Wadsworth had few kind words for the insurgents, whom he frequently referred to by racial epithets, and commented not only on their primitive weapons -- mostly bows, arrows and shields, but also on their tactics. By Wadsworth's reckoning, the insurgents battled American soldiers two or three times a week, and were known to jump out of trees in ambush (173). ; In other letters, Wadsworth turned his eye to the battered Spanish gunboats in Manila Bay (158), the American victory at Manila (160), Filipino civilians (158, 159, 160), and Chinese laborers engaged in the novelty trade (160, 161), and whom the Filipinos hated (161). Referring to Manila, Andrew wrote that it was ""behind the times,"" but that it had the finest electric lighting he had ever seen. He asserted, however, that the Filipinos were not concerned with cleanliness: people suffering from either smallpox or leprosy walked the streets of Cavite openly, and Filipino civilians removed the clothes of dead Spanish soldiers and resold them. Andrew himself bought a pair of pants and a shirt. ; The Hussey-Wadsworth Papers also provide a brief but interesting description of trenches and bombing during the First World War (210), and there is brief commentary on censorship, the German retreat, and the determination of American soldiers (208, 210). One letter refers to the bombing of London during Word War II (232) and to war rationing in both the United States and Great Britain (231, 232). ; According to Mekeel's Weekly Stamp News, George Tuttle Hussey sold stamps to collectors and issued bronze pennies.

When George Hussey's widow, Elisabeth Nichols Hussey, remarried to David Wheeler Tuttle, the step-father's surname was appended to the baby's as a middle name. Despite the resulting differences in names, the baby was routinely identified as ""George III"" and, in turn, his son George Alexander Hussey (1843-1929), was called ""George IV."" ; In 1836, at the age of twenty-four, George Tuttle Hussey embarked on what would become a thirty-five year career at the Bank of New York in New York City. On the side, he assisting in founding the Bank and Insurance City Post in September, 1854, which changed name four years later to Hussey's Instant Special Message Post. Hussey and his employees presented drafts, notes, and checks at banks for payment or certification, and the firm employed between 25 and 40 messengers, who delivered notes, packages, and bundles to Brooklyn, Jersey City, Yorkville, Harlem, Staten Island, and other places in the metropolitan area. Besides founding the Message Post, Hussey helped establish the Church of Atonement in Brooklyn. He died July 3, 1890, aged 78, and was survived by his wife, Mary Jane Alexander, and two children, Mary Hussey Blair and George Alexander Hussey. ; George Alexander Hussey was born December 23, 1843, in either Bergen, N.J., or New York City. As a young member of the economic elite of the city, Hussey took the de rigeur European tour at age seventeen, traveling across Switzerland and Bavaria, brushing up on his German and soaking up the local culture, but he had a rude awakening on returning home: political crisis. In July, 1861, three months after the Civil War began, Hussey enlisted as a private in Company I, 9th New York Militia Regiment (the New York City Guards), which was mustered into the federal service as the 83rd New York Infantry Regiment. During most of 1861, the 83rd Regiment was stationed in the ring of forts surrounding Washington, but late in the fall, they were reassigned to western Maryland and served for a time as the body guard for Gen. N.P. Banks. During the summer, they took part in the Shenandoah Campaign, and returned to the eastern part of the state, arriving to participate in the Bull Run campaign. ; During the 2nd Battle of Bull Run on August 30, 1862, Hussey was wounded in the chest and spent time recuperating in Philadelphia's National Guard Hospital. After recovering, he accepted a commission as first lieutenant in Co. I of the 103rd New York Infantry, formed in part from remnants of the 3rd German Rifles. The 103rd served primarily in southeastern Virginia, and were present at Suffolk during the siege, where on May 3, 1863, Hussey was wounded in action for a second time. Just under a month later, he was promoted to Captain of Co. E, and that November, he was discharged at the expiration of his two years' obligation. He returned to military life one final time, beginning May, 1864, as a member of New York's 165th Regiment, serving through the end of the war and receiving an honorable discharge in September, 1865. ; Returning to civilian life, George served as his father's secretary from September, 1865, to October, 1866, leaving that position for a job with the Merchants' Union Express Company. However when that company merged with the American Express Company in March, 1869, George was let go. Four months later, he landed with the Fourth National Bank of New York City, where he held a number of positions. While employed at the bank, he married Carrie Elisabeth St. John on November 25, 1875. Sixteen years later, George resigned as coupon collection clerk. According to a biography of the New York Volunteers of the 103rd Regiment, he later received a job with the Treasury Department. At the time of his death in 1929, he was a resident of Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. ; Andrew S. Wadsworth was the son of John Gilbert and Sarah Ashby Wadsworth. Born in New Lebanon, N.Y., on October 2, 1870, he enlisted in the 1st Nebraska Infantry on April 27, 1898, only a few days before Admiral George Dewey moved his fleet into Manila Bay. In July, Wadsworth and the 1st Nebraska Regiment arrived in the Philippines and commenced active campaigning. On April 23, 1899, while fighting Filipino insurgents, he was shot twice in the leg, and spent the next nine months as a convalescent in Manila and San Francisco hospitals. ; After returning to the States, Andrew spent much of his time trying to get his military pension increased, which, in 1901, was set at only fifteen dollars per month. It was twenty years before he saw any increase in his pension, which fluctuated wildly in value during the Depression before peaking in 1944, at a rate of sixty dollars per month. In the following year, approximately forty-six years after being wounded, he was awarded the Purple Heart. ; The Husseys are related to Andrew Wadsworth only through George T. Hussey's great-grandson, George William DeBell, who married Wadsworth's niece, Jean Wadsworth Hasbrouck."

Dickman between January and October 1945.  Eva wrote around 200 letters between December 31, 1944, and August 4, 1945, and Robert responded, with approximately 200 letters, written between January 1, 1945, and October 19, 1945.  Eva shared news of her social life and her experiences running the couple's pharmacy in Kokomo, Indiana, and Robert described aspects of military life and, particularly after the Japanese surrender, his movements around the Pacific.; Eva wrote almost daily letters that were typically between 1 and 3 pages. She met with other military spouses, discussed her religious life, and expressed her concern and love for her husband.  Occasionally, she commented on national news stories, such as President Franklin Roosevelt's death (April 14, 1945) and the likelihood of German surrender (May 7, 1945).  In his letters, Robert concentrated on his experiences aboard the USS Joseph T. Dickman, a hospital and transport ship, in the Pacific Theater.  He initially wrote less frequently than his wife, but by mid-August 1945, he sent letters almost daily and provided her with commentary on navy life and his religious activities.  Though censorship initially forced Hutto to be vague about his locations, he described the Joseph T. Dickman's travels between Boston and San Francisco in a letter dated January 17, 1945, and reported on his initiation as a ""pollywog"" who had traveled across the equator (February 9, 1945).  On May 1, 1945, he announced that censorship had been partially lifted and that he was allowed to share some of his experiences, including travels to the New Hebrides, Guadalcanal, and Tulagi Island.  In the same letter he gave a scant description of his involvement in the liberation of Okinawa.  After the Japanese surrender on August 14, 1945, he openly shared his travel plans, which included trips between San Francisco and islands such as Enewetak Atoll and the Philippines.  He also revealed that he had spent time in the Hawaiian Islands while the ship was being outfitted with medical facilities.  After his ship anchored at Manila Harbor on September 17, 1945, he provided his impressions of the destruction around Manila, which included the sunken ships throughout its harbor.  In his final letters, Hutto anticipated his discharge, which took place in mid-October.; The couple's letters reveal their affection for one another, as well as the effects of lengthy separation on their relationship.  On January 20, 1945, Robert Hutto sent his wife a Valentine's Day card, and most letters end with professions of love or, on at least one occasion, a kiss from Eva marked in lipstick.  Other items of interest are an anniversary card (July 16, 1945) and a card bearing a cartoon illustration of a Hawaiian dancer and a brief poem about Hawaii (June 24, 1945).  Two of Eva's letters include enclosures: a piece of fabric (January 29, 1945) and a newspaper advertisement (February 7, 1945).  In addition to Robert's letters, Eva received 1 letter from Captain Ward R. Kidder of the 29th Field Artillery Battalion, about his experiences in Luxembourg (December 19, 1944).

She tried to work out differences peacefully but still felt that she ended up doing more work than they, adding to the difficulty she felt in the need to balance her work and keeping house: ""Sometimes I wonder whether I'm doing a good job of housekeeping, and whether it will be the way you'd like to find it when you return. I know it's not a perfect job, but I excuse it by saying that you can't hold down two jobs and do them both perfectly."" Jane felt obligated to spend time with both her own family and Johnson's. To help ease the situation, Jane's mother suggested she move home until the war ended ""to save money."" However Jane wanted to maintain her independence and refused. ; The effects of rationing were painfully evident during the holidays. ""Turkeys were very scarce this year. You could get them through black markets at about $1 a pound, and some few people were able to get them at a legitimate price..."" Cigarettes and sugar were scarce as well. Jane regretted that butter, milk, and eggs were considered part of the meat ration. Her neighbor down the hall often procured meat for her because she had a butcher who would sell her extra. The black market flourished. ; While billeted in Stolberg, Germany, Johnson also complained of shortages: ""Certain war correspondents has said the shell shortage is not due so much to the lack of production as failure to foresee the tremendous need--whatever the cause we need stuff--now!"" He mentioned that work strikes by war plant workers made him furious because the soldiers suffered from the shortage of ammunitions. ; On December 16, 1944, the Germans mustered their forces for a last major offensive in the Ardennes. On Christmas day, just five kilometers from the front, Johnson wrote his wife to tell her that he had saved her packages to open on Christmas, although in reality, he had already opened them fearing that he would not live until Christmas. Johnson survived the Battle of the Bulge, earning a Bronze Star in the process. ; Johnson's company liberated Nordhausen, one of the concentration camps in Germany in early April 1945, near the end of the war. He was horrified by the sight: ""Nearly 500 foreign slave laborers were lying in filth nearly dead from starvation in town."" What he saw in Germany piqued his hatred of the German civilians, and he complained of a ""feeling of disgust"" when seeing German civilians: ""They collect pictures of Hitler and the Luftwaffe. When they cry now that such and such is a hardship, I feel like telling them to write a letter to Hitler."" ; With the war in Europe ended in May, 1945, Johnson desperately longed to return home, but did not have enough points to do so. He remained in Germany through the summer and fall, billeted in Egelsbach, where he set up a beer hall for officers and enlisted men, and where they even served lunch. Due in part to his Bronze Star, Johnson was promoted to Master Sergeant before boarding the Montclair Victory Ship on October 19 1945, bound for the States. ; Upon learning that the war was over, Johnson told his wife to quit her job immediately, reasoning that he would be able to stay at the job he had left working for a textile company.

Billeted in Cucklington, England, Johnson found the conditions surprisingly comfortable: ""No tent stuff but warm, comfortable, permanent type barracks -- we even eat from plates."" Johnson was even able to travel to London to take courses and enjoy a brief furlough, and only shelling from the Luftwaffe dampened spirits. ; Shortly after D-Day in mid-June 1944, however, the 3rd Armored Division left England for Cherbourg, France. Joining with troops who had survived the invasion of Normandy, they concentrated their forces to push the Germans out of northeastern France and soon found themselves in the midst of intense fighting. At Ariel, ""a hard fighting town shelled to rubble,"" Johnson saw his first dead American. Johnson's duties in the Signal Corps involved moving ahead of the division to lay wire for communications, an uncertain and dangerous task. ""Once laid wire down a freshly taken road.

Billeted in Cucklington, England, Johnson found the conditions surprisingly comfortable: ""No tent stuff but warm, comfortable, permanent type barracks -- we even eat from plates."" Johnson was even able to travel to London to take courses and enjoy a brief furlough, and only shelling from the Luftwaffe dampened spirits. ; Shortly after D-Day in mid-June 1944, however, the 3rd Armored Division left England for Cherbourg, France. Joining with troops who had survived the invasion of Normandy, they concentrated their forces to push the Germans out of northeastern France and soon found themselves in the midst of intense fighting. At Ariel, ""a hard fighting town shelled to rubble,"" Johnson saw his first dead American. Johnson's duties in the Signal Corps involved moving ahead of the division to lay wire for communications, an uncertain and dangerous task. ""Once laid wire down a freshly taken road. [D]idn't know if it had been cleared of mines; wasn't even sure it was the right road."" The next day he learned that the 300 Germans had come within 200 yards of him. ""If I'd known that,"" he said, ""I don't know whether duty would've come first."" ; As the Division moved slowly toward Belgium, they met resistance from the Germans at every turn. At the Battle of Mons in Belgium, Johnson reported that Germans were beginning to surrender en masse: ""A captain came out and offered to lead 120 Jerry soldiers and tell them to surrender. We accepted -- 580 came out."" They drove into Germany in September 1944, and billeted in Stolberg for almost a month. There, Johnson grew discontented with the decisions made by the commanding officers: ; "

Johnson Papers,Dead,1,bioghist,"         ; At home, Jane's new job responsibilities brought her into contact with a supervisor and colleague whom she did not like. She tried to work out differences peacefully but still felt that she ended up doing more work than they, adding to the difficulty she felt in the need to balance her work and keeping house: ""Sometimes I wonder whether I'm doing a good job of housekeeping, and whether it will be the way you'd like to find it when you return. I know it's not a perfect job, but I excuse it by saying that you can't hold down two jobs and do them both perfectly."" Jane felt obligated to spend time with both her own family and Johnson's. To help ease the situation, Jane's mother suggested she move home until the war ended ""to save money."" However Jane wanted to maintain her independence and refused. ; The effects of rationing were painfully evident during the holidays. ""Turkeys were very scarce this year. You could get them through black markets at about $1 a pound, and some few people were able to get them at a legitimate price..."" Cigarettes and sugar were scarce as well. Jane regretted that butter, milk, and eggs were considered part of the meat ration. Her neighbor down the hall often procured meat for her because she had a butcher who would sell her extra. The black market flourished. ; While billeted in Stolberg, Germany, Johnson also complained of shortages: ""Certain war correspondents has said the shell shortage is not due so much to the lack of production as failure to foresee the tremendous need--whatever the cause we need stuff--now!"" He mentioned that work strikes by war plant workers made him furious because the soldiers suffered from the shortage of ammunitions. ; On December 16, 1944, the Germans mustered their forces for a last major offensive in the Ardennes. On Christmas day, just five kilometers from the front, Johnson wrote his wife to tell her that he had saved her packages to open on Christmas, although in reality, he had already opened them fearing that he would not live until Christmas. Johnson survived the Battle of the Bulge, earning a Bronze Star in the process. ; Johnson's company liberated Nordhausen, one of the concentration camps in Germany in early April 1945, near the end of the war. He was horrified by the sight: ""Nearly 500 foreign slave laborers were lying in filth nearly dead from starvation in town."" What he saw in Germany piqued his hatred of the German civilians, and he complained of a ""feeling of disgust"" when seeing German civilians: ""They collect pictures of Hitler and the Luftwaffe. When they cry now that such and such is a hardship, I feel like telling them to write a letter to Hitler."" ; With the war in Europe ended in May, 1945, Johnson desperately longed to return home, but did not have enough points to do so. He remained in Germany through the summer and fall, billeted in Egelsbach, where he set up a beer hall for officers and enlisted men, and where they even served lunch. Due in part to his Bronze Star, Johnson was promoted to Master Sergeant before boarding the Montclair Victory Ship on October 19 1945, bound for the States. ; Upon learning that the war was over, Johnson told his wife to quit her job immediately, reasoning that he would be able to stay at the job he had left working for a textile company. The couple wanted to start a family as soon as possible. "

Arthur MacArthur (1845-1912) and Mary Pinkney Hardy (1852-1935). His siblings were Arthur (1876-1923), and Malcolm (1878-1883), who died before his seventh birthday. ; Douglas MacArthur graduated from West Texas Military Academy in 1897 as valedictorian and two years later entered West Point.  In 1903 he graduated as First Captain, West Point's highest honor.  In September 1903, he joined the 3rd Battalion Engineers in San Francisco, and almost immediately was sent to Manila, Philippines. The next year he was promoted to First Lieutenant, and in 1906 returned to the United States.  After being made Captain of Engineers at Leavenworth in 1911, MacArthur was assigned to Vera Cruz to report information to the War Department.  While serving as military aide to the Secretary of War in 1916, he conceived the idea of expanding the existing National Guard through volunteer enlistment and turned into combat divisions - an idea that would be used for the formation of the 42nd Division. ; In 1917, MacArthur was appointed Colonel and Chief of Staff of the 42nd (Rainbow) Division.  As Commander of the 84th Infantry Brigade, he led his troops during the vitally important Argonne Campaign in the last months of the war.  In 1919, the 42nd Division returned to the United States, and MacArthur accepted an appointment as Superintendent of West Point.  While there, he became permanent Brigadier General.  MacArthur married Louise Cromwell Brooks in 1922, the year he was posted to command the Philippine Division, but they divorced seven years later. In November 1929, MacArthur was promoted to General and chosen as the man to replace General Summerall as the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army.  In 1937, MacArthur married a second time - to Jean Marie Faircloth, and they had a son, Arthur, a year later. ; In December 1941, the Japanese Army attacked and defeated MacArthur's Philippine Army on the Bataan Peninsula.  The following March, MacArthur was ordered from the Philippines to command the Allied troops with Thomas Blamey.  For six months, MacArthur concentrated on the defense of New Guinea, which led to an ambitious counter-attack in January and February 1943.  On the day the Japanese surrendered, MacArthur was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Powers. ; MacArthur remained in occupied Japan until 1950, orchestrating the reformation of the post-war country.  On the 29th of June, 1950, MacArthur went to South Korea with American forces to assess the situation after North Korea's invasion of South Korea.  This assessment led to Truman's commitment of U.S. troops to a ground war in Korea.  The North Koreans abandoned Seoul on September 28, 1950, after MacArthur's successful military plan to attack through Inchon.  As a result of the success of this campaign, China decided to enter the Korean War.  MacArthur was ordered by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with a U.N. resolution, to proceed north of the 38th parallel.  Chinese troops attacked, leading to the withdrawal of MacArthur's troops back south of the 38th.  By this time, MacArthur had disobeyed the military order to employ only Korean forces in the frontier provinces.  On the 24th of March, MacArthur issued a lengthy communiqué complaining about the restrictions on his forces and taunted the enemy for their lack of industrial power and inability to maintain even moderate air and naval power. This pronouncement and his previous insubordination caused President Truman to relieve MacArthur of his command. ; In April 1951, General Douglas MacArthur returned to San Francisco to thousands of cheering citizens.  On April 19 he presented his case regarding his relief of command to a joint session of congress.  During his remaining years, MacArthur traveled throughout the United States to make speeches, in which he often denounced communists and socialists, and spoke of corrupt administration and heavy taxation. At the age of 84, on April 5, 1964, Douglas MacArthur died in a hospital in Washington.; "

The 42nd arrived in Europe in 1917 as the war was entering a new phase: Russia had dropped out of the war, America was joining the war, and Germany was racing to provide tremendous reinforcement before the American forces arrived. ; In February 1918 the 42nd Division, part of the First U.S. Army Corps, was ordered to the Luneville area for a month of training with French units from the 7th French Army Corps.  While there, the Rainbow Division distinguished itself as ""a first class combat Division."" ; The first assignment for the 42nd was to relieve the 128th French Infantry Division from the Baccarat Sector.  In the war, this was the first time an American Division held a Sector on its own.  The Division successfully held the Baccarat Sector until relief orders were sent on June 16, 1918.  Two weeks later, the 42nd Division went to the front at the Battle of Champagne alongside the 21st French Army Corps.  After an attack by the Germans on the fifteenth of July, the 42nd assisted in the Champagne defense until the end of the battle (July 18).  The Sixth French Army Corps was given the Rainbow Division to pursue the supposedly retreating enemy at the Battle of the Ourcq from July 25-July 27, 1918. From July 28-August 1st, the Allies captured strongpoints of the German position.  August 2-August 3rd, the 42nd Division assisted in pursuing the enemy until relieved by the 4th Regular Division. ; After the Battle of the Ourcq, Douglas MacArthur was given command of the 84th Infantry Brigade (William Hughes, Jr., replaced him as Chief of Staff, 42nd Division).  In September, the Rainbow Division, then under the 4th American Army Corps, was ordered to attack the center of the south side of the San Mihiel Salient and was assigned to the defense of the Essey-Pannes Sector until September 30, when it was relieved by the 89th Division. ; On October 11-12, 1918, the Rainbow Division relieved the 1st Division on the Verdun front.  In order to break the 2nd German line of defense, the hill called The Cote de Chatillon had to be taken.  From October 13-16, Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur commanded the 84th Infantry Division to the successful capture of Hill 288 (a strongly fortified point on the Kreimhilde Stellung), the Tuilerie Ferme, and the Cote de Chatillon (beyond the enemy's strong line of resistance). ; The next attack took place November 1, 1918.  The 42nd Division provided machine gun fire for the advancement of the 2nd and 89th Divisions.  After this victory, and as a result of divisional rivalry (and a difference in opinion as to the exact nature of a memorandum), the 42nd and the 1st Divisions (of the First American Army Corps and the 5th American Army Corps respectively) 'raced' for the glory of partaking in the (potential) final engagement of the war, in Sedan.  On November 6-7, the Rainbow, the 4th French Army, and the 1st and 77th American Divisions, fought south of the Meuse (south of Sedan).  The fighting ended when the enemy requested an armistice on November 9, 1918.  The 42nd Division backed off and was able to claim that the Americans who got closest to Sedan were members of the 166th Infantry of the 83rd Infantry Brigade.  The armistice was signed two days later. ; The 42nd Division remained in France and occupied Germany until May 1, 1919, when the last unit arrived home.

This collection of 140 items consists of correspondence, newsletters, and newspaper clippings that her parents, Guy H. and Vivian C. Hewitt of Columbus, Ohio, received and collected during their daughter's imprisonment.; The Correspondence and Newsletters series comprises the bulk of the collection.  The first 7 items are personal letters that Howard Joseph Schlereth wrote to Mary Virginia Hewitt from August 26, 1930-March 1933.  Schlereth first anticipated his journey to the Philippines, where he worked for the Standard Oil Company of New York (later the Sandard-Vacuum Oil Company), and later wrote brief letters about his life there.  He commented on his separation from and love for Mary.  His letter of November 7, 1930, has a manuscript floor plan of the cabin he shared with an acquaintance during a voyage from San Francisco to the Philippines.  Mary Virginia Hewitt Schlereth wrote a letter to her family on December 1, 1941, about the expected delay of the family's planned trip back to the United States from the Philippines, where they had been living for several years.; From December 11, 1941-March 1944, Guy H. and Vivian C. Hewitt compiled around 100 personal letters, official letters, circular letters, telegrams, and newsletters about the internment of American citizens and other expatriates in the Philippines following the Japanese invasion of December 1941.  They corresponded with representatives from the Standard-Vacuum Oil Company, the United States Department of State, the United States Department of War, the United States House of Representatives, and Relief for Americans in Philippines, who responded to the Hewitts' requests for information about their daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren.  Correspondents reported general and specific news about American internees as it became available, and the Hewitts first received definite news of their relatives' safety in May 1942.  The letters concern possible evacuation efforts, the inability of United States officials to communicate with people in enemy territories during a state of war, procedures for sending mail to interned Americans, and living conditions in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp.  A society called ""Relief for Americans in Philippines"" regularly sent newsletters about the internees and about prisoner exchange efforts and occasionally provided receipts for the Hewitts' donations.  Some exchanged internees who had returned home provided news of the Schlereths from their own personal recollections, and acquaintances sometimes wrote letters of sympathy.  Around three items are copies of the Schlereth family's brief communications from Manila, which bore news of their good health.; The final items in the series are personal letters and greeting cards sent to the Hewitt family by acquaintances in early 1945.  Writers expressed relief upon hearing that Manila had been taken by the Allied forces and after learning that the Schlereth family had survived the war.; The Printed Items and Ephemera series includes 13 pages of newspaper clippings about the Schlereth family and about the Japanese internment of Americans in the Philippines during World War II.  Most pages have several pasted clippings, and the majority of clippings are dated 1942.  The series also has an article entitled ""Yankee Girl: Adventures of a Young American Who Spent Five Months in Jap Internment Camp at Manila,"" in which Frances Long recollected her experiences at Santo Tomas Internment Camp.  The article was published in Life on September 7, 1942.  Other items are a check that Guy H. Hewitt wrote to Relief for Americans in Philippines and 2 Philippine stamps."

105,umich-wcl-M-66she,shelburnew_final.xml,"Finding Aid for William Petty, 1st Marquis of Lansdowne, 2nd Earl of Shelburne Papers",Death,2,bioghist,"William Petty, 1st Marquis of Lansdowne, 2nd Earl of Shelburne (1737--1805), hereafter referred to as Shelburne, was born in Dublin, Ireland, to John Fitzmaurice Petty (1706-1761) and Mary Fitzmaurice (d 1780).  He served with distinction in Germany during the Seven Years War, achieving the rank of colonel and in 1760, he became King George's aide-de-camp.  Later that year he took over his family's seat in Parliament representing Chipping Wycombe.  After his father's death in May 1761, he entered the House of Lords as Baron Wycombe, second earl of Shelburne.  During his tenure in the House of Lords, Shelburne served as first lord of the Board of Trade (1763), as secretary of state for the Southern Department, as home secretary under Rockingham (March-July 1782), and as prime minister (1782-1783).  As an official dealing with American affairs, a stockholder in the East India Company, and a landowner in Ireland, Shelburne was involved in many of the major issues affecting the British Empire in the mid-eighteenth century.   ; Though shrewd and ambitious, Shelburne frequently allied himself with unpopular politicians, such as John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, and William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, and often found himself in the opposition party.  Shelburne also advocated for controversial policies such as free trade, religious tolerance, and parliamentary and fiscal reforms, which contributed to his unpopularity.  In 1763, Shelburne became first lord of the Board of Trade and played an important role in drafting the regulations for England's newly acquired empire in North America.  He opposed the Stamp Act and supported its repeal.  As secretary of state for the Southern Department during the Chatham administration (1766-1768), he oversaw America, India, and Ireland, and had diplomatic responsibilities to France, Spain, and other southern European countries.  He was at odds with many of his colleagues, particularly for wanting to avoid tax increases for America.  After resigning from the office, he spent the next 14 years as a leader of the opposition party and as an outspoken opponent of the war with America.  In March 1782, Shelburne accepted the appointment of Home Secretary under Rockingham.  Upon Rockingham's death in July 1782, Shelburne became prime minister, and directed the peace negotiations with the American commissioners that resulted in the controversial 1783 Treaty of Paris.  Parliament disapproved of the treaty's terms and, in March 1783, Shelburne resigned, making way for the North-Fox coalition.  ; After the end of his political career, Shelburne remained well informed on international affairs, commissioning reports on Europe and other foreign powers' finances and military forces.  He amassed a sizable collection of books, pamphlets, and manuscripts, maps, prints, statues, and other material related to art, science, and politics.  He associated with, and was a patron of, many of the most learned men of his time, including Benjamin Franklin, André Morellet, Joseph Priestley, Adam Smith, and Jeremy Bentham.; Shelburne married twice, first in 1765 to Lady Sophia Carteret (1745-1771) and then to Lady Louisa Fitzpatrick (1755-1789) in 1779.  He was created marquis in 1784, assuming the title of 1st Marquis of Lansdowne.  He died in 1805 and was succeeded by his son John, 2nd Marquis of Lansdowne (1765-1809).  ; Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 4th Earl of Kerry, 3rd Marquis of Lansdowne (1780-1863), was the son of Shelburne and his second wife Lady Louisa Fitzpatrick.  He served as chancellor of the exchequer from 1806-1807 and, in 1809, succeeded his half brother John to the Lansdowne title.  From 1830-1841 and 1846-1852, Lansdowne was lord president of the Council.  He married Louisa Emma Fox-Strangways (1785-1851) in 1808.  The couple maintained correspondence with friend Reverend William Lisle Bowles (1762-1850) and his wife Magdalen Wake.  William was the vicar of Bremhill, Wiltshire, from 1804 to 1850, and the chaplain to the prince regent in 1818.  He was also a famous poet and literary critic. ; Italian politician and Dante scholar James Lacaita (1813-1895) was born in Manduria, Italy, and practiced law in Naples.  In 1840, Lacaita became a legal advisor to the British legation in Naples.  Though a moderate liberal, he was arrested in 1851 for supplying the British government with information on the new Bourbon autocracy.  Escaping arrest, he left Italy for Edinbugh and married Maria Clavering Gibson-Carmichael.  Their son, Charles Carmichael Lacaita (1853-1933), later became a Member of Parliament from 1885-1888.  James Lacaita and his family moved to London and he taught Italian at Queens College from 1853 to 1856.  Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquis of Lansdowne, employed Lacaita as his personal secretary between 1857 and 1863.  In 1860, Lacaita returned to Naples to represent Bitonto in parliament, and in 1876, he became an Italian senator.  He died near Naples in 1895."

110,umich-wcl-M-3367tap,tapson_final.xml,Finding Aid for John Tapson Journal,Enemy,1,bioghist,"As Captain's Clerk aboard the H.M.S. Defiance and Cyane, and as purser aboard the Africaine, John Tapson was witness to several significant naval engagements during the Napoleonic Wars. Boarding the 74 gun frigate, Defiance, in April, 1806, Tapson served uneventfully off the coasts of Brittany, Portugal, and Spain until January, 1808, when he was transferred to the Cyane. ; Passing through the Straits of Gibraltar in February, the Cyane took part in patrolling the Spanish and French coasts, intercepting vessels carrying contraband or goods to the enemy and making occasional landings to engage French ground forces. Interactions between the ship and shore, taking place at something of a distance, were not always as fraught with peril as might be supposed, and sometimes descended to the ridiculous. The day after being driven from Calella, Catalonia, on August 14, 1808, for instance, French troops returned to greet the crew of the Cyane with light arms and insults. For Tapson, the most striking insult was delivered by a daring French cavalry officer, who exhibited ""a singular display of personal daring, and contempt of danger; for he walked deliberately down to the water's edge with his arms folded over his chest, then turned his Back towards the Ship, and with the utmost 'Sang Froid,' threw the skirt of this Coat over his head, stooped forward & slapped his Hands on a certain part (which is sometimes called the seat of honor) with all the contempt & scorn of our power it was possible by such means to convey"" (p. 36). Captain Staines of the Cyane took the insult personally on behalf of all of the sailors, and assuming personal command of a twelve pounder, exchanged shots with the Frenchman. Frightened, but undaunted, the French officer saw fit ""to continue his indecent exhibition with redoubled energy"" until on the third shot, the Captain's aim proved true. Tapson was repelled by the brutality of the Spanish troops, as much as he was critical of their inefficacy compared to the French. Of a like mind, Captain Staines ordered his men ashore to rally the Spaniards, and to assist in driving off the French rifles. Clearly more comfortable at sea than on land, Staines quickly withdrew, narrowly avoiding capture. ; In May, 1809, the Cyane proceeded to the Bay of Naples, landing at Monte Cecilia to capture a pair of ill-equipped, lightly defended martello towers, and remaining in the region for over two months, intercepting shipping and interrupting land operations whenever possible. In one particularly violent clash with Neapolitan ships during the summer, the Cyane lost 3 men, 27 injured. Among the injured was Capt. Staines, whose arm was shattered by grape shot. He withstood the pain well, according to Tapson, even requesting while his arm was being amputated that the ring on the little finger be carefully preserved. ; In October, 1809, the Cyane returned to England. Tapson awaited his next appointment until June, 1810, when he was made purser to the H.M.S.  Africaine, captained by the sadistic Robert Corbet. Less than three weeks after joining the Africaine, Tapson recorded that ""A most violent prejudice has arisen in the minds of the Ships' Company against the appointment of Capt. Corbet"" (p. 65) due to his ""oppressive & tyrannical"" treatment of previous crews. A near mutiny averted by the intervention of Sir George Coburn, Corbet's arrival aboard ship was nevertheless greeted with a sullen response by the crew, who let it be known that they had little intention of submitting easily to Corbet's harsh discipline. Indicative of their state of mind, the sulking crew refused to hold the shellbacks ceremony on crossing the equator, and a short while later, the arrest of a marine for insubordination prompted one anonymous member of the crew to send a death threat to the Captain. As inept in reading his crew as he was harsh, Corbet ordered his officers to arm themselves, confronted the crew and read the letter to all, insisting that ""it was his fixed determination to be a great deal more severe than he had ever yet been,"" sentencing the offending marine to eight dozen lashes as a demonstration of his intentions, taunting the crew in the process (p. 69-70). According to Tapson, Corbet's bullying found its mark: ""If the People had before this entertained any doubts of the Nerve & determined character of their Captain, they must now no doubt have been undeceived"" (p.71). ; Arming the watch to ensure that no mutinous attempts would be tried, the Africaine passed the Cape of Good Hope on August 19th and in September, touched at the Island of Rodriguez before joining in the naval assault of Grand Port, Mauritius. The Africaine parried with French warships of the coast until the 13th, when, against the advice of his Lieut. Tullidge, Corbet ordered his ship to press forward without support. After becoming embroiled in a fierce battle, the Africaine was laid out helpless when the wind died to a calm, and was subjected to a withering fire that disabled or unmanned most of her guns. Tullidge and the remaining officers reluctantly ordered the colors to be stricken, but, enraging the crew, Corbet shouted ""For shame, hoist the colors again, fight and go down!"" Tullidge pleaded with the Captain, insisting that he damage done had already been too great, and the ship was turned over to the French. Knowing no French, Corbet at last ordered Tapson to interpret in the negotiations, and after some ungentlemanly treatment by a Republican seaman, the crew of the Africaine were taken aboard the French ship, Iphigenie. At dawn, the English frigate, Boadicea, was spotted bearing down under heavy sail, and it was able to retake the unmasted Africaine, though it made no attempt to rescue its crew after seeing how badly mangled they must be. In this, the captain of Boadicea was accurate: the Africaine had suffered a loss of 49 dead and 114 wounded -- more than half the crew. ; The officers of the Africaine were placed into a prison ship at Port Louis while the enlisted were billeted ashore. Within a few days, the prisoners were liberated by the British landing force that had captured Grand Port. To the relief of the crew, they learned that Corbet had died of wounds received, having apparently killed himself by removing a tourniquet and bleeding to death, rather than submit to the humiliation of capture. Aboard a captured frigate, Astrée, Tapson returned to England, arriving in April. The officers were subsequently fully exonerated at court martial for their part in the capture of the Africaine. ; In August, 1811, Tapson rejoined the Africaine for a tour in the South Seas. Making a circuitous route from Sri Lanka to India and Indonesia, then back to India, the Africaine arrived in Bombay on January 1, 1813, just in time to receive word that war had been declared between the United States and Britain. The Africaine was immediately charged with intercepting a small fleet of American merchantmen (valued at £300,000 each) from Canton and set sail once again for the East Indies. Meeting the Minden in Madras, the Africaine laid in wait for the American ships in the Straits of Malacca, but found nothing. After several months of duty off of Sumatra and Malaysia, they were ordered to the Euphrates River to suppress piracy, but when they again found little to do, they returned to Indonesia, going as far east as the Moluccas (Maluku), the Celebes (Sulawesi), Banda, and Timor before pulling into port in the Philippines just before Christmas, 1814.

Less than three weeks after joining the Africaine, Tapson recorded that ""A most violent prejudice has arisen in the minds of the Ships' Company against the appointment of Capt. Corbet"" (p. 65) due to his ""oppressive & tyrannical"" treatment of previous crews. A near mutiny averted by the intervention of Sir George Coburn, Corbet's arrival aboard ship was nevertheless greeted with a sullen response by the crew, who let it be known that they had little intention of submitting easily to Corbet's harsh discipline. Indicative of their state of mind, the sulking crew refused to hold the shellbacks ceremony on crossing the equator, and a short while later, the arrest of a marine for insubordination prompted one anonymous member of the crew to send a death threat to the Captain. As inept in reading his crew as he was harsh, Corbet ordered his officers to arm themselves, confronted the crew and read the letter to all, insisting that ""it was his fixed determination to be a great deal more severe than he had ever yet been,"" sentencing the offending marine to eight dozen lashes as a demonstration of his intentions, taunting the crew in the process (p. 69-70). According to Tapson, Corbet's bullying found its mark: ""If the People had before this entertained any doubts of the Nerve & determined character of their Captain, they must now no doubt have been undeceived"" (p.71). ; Arming the watch to ensure that no mutinous attempts would be tried, the Africaine passed the Cape of Good Hope on August 19th and in September, touched at the Island of Rodriguez before joining in the naval assault of Grand Port, Mauritius. The Africaine parried with French warships of the coast until the 13th, when, against the advice of his Lieut. Tullidge, Corbet ordered his ship to press forward without support. After becoming embroiled in a fierce battle, the Africaine was laid out helpless when the wind died to a calm, and was subjected to a withering fire that disabled or unmanned most of her guns. Tullidge and the remaining officers reluctantly ordered the colors to be stricken, but, enraging the crew, Corbet shouted ""For shame, hoist the colors again, fight and go down!"" Tullidge pleaded with the Captain, insisting that he damage done had already been too great, and the ship was turned over to the French. Knowing no French, Corbet at last ordered Tapson to interpret in the negotiations, and after some ungentlemanly treatment by a Republican seaman, the crew of the Africaine were taken aboard the French ship, Iphigenie. At dawn, the English frigate, Boadicea, was spotted bearing down under heavy sail, and it was able to retake the unmasted Africaine, though it made no attempt to rescue its crew after seeing how badly mangled they must be. In this, the captain of Boadicea was accurate: the Africaine had suffered a loss of 49 dead and 114 wounded -- more than half the crew. ; The officers of the Africaine were placed into a prison ship at Port Louis while the enlisted were billeted ashore. Within a few days, the prisoners were liberated by the British landing force that had captured Grand Port. To the relief of the crew, they learned that Corbet had died of wounds received, having apparently killed himself by removing a tourniquet and bleeding to death, rather than submit to the humiliation of capture. Aboard a captured frigate, Astrée, Tapson returned to England, arriving in April. The officers were subsequently fully exonerated at court martial for their part in the capture of the Africaine. ; In August, 1811, Tapson rejoined the Africaine for a tour in the South Seas. Making a circuitous route from Sri Lanka to India and Indonesia, then back to India, the Africaine arrived in Bombay on January 1, 1813, just in time to receive word that war had been declared between the United States and Britain. The Africaine was immediately charged with intercepting a small fleet of American merchantmen (valued at £300,000 each) from Canton and set sail once again for the East Indies. Meeting the Minden in Madras, the Africaine laid in wait for the American ships in the Straits of Malacca, but found nothing. After several months of duty off of Sumatra and Malaysia, they were ordered to the Euphrates River to suppress piracy, but when they again found little to do, they returned to Indonesia, going as far east as the Moluccas (Maluku), the Celebes (Sulawesi), Banda, and Timor before pulling into port in the Philippines just before Christmas, 1814.

115,umich-wcl-M-3367tap,tapson_final.xml,Finding Aid for John Tapson Journal,Dead,1,bioghist,"As Captain's Clerk aboard the H.M.S. Defiance and Cyane, and as purser aboard the Africaine, John Tapson was witness to several significant naval engagements during the Napoleonic Wars. Boarding the 74 gun frigate, Defiance, in April, 1806, Tapson served uneventfully off the coasts of Brittany, Portugal, and Spain until January, 1808, when he was transferred to the Cyane. ; Passing through the Straits of Gibraltar in February, the Cyane took part in patrolling the Spanish and French coasts, intercepting vessels carrying contraband or goods to the enemy and making occasional landings to engage French ground forces. Interactions between the ship and shore, taking place at something of a distance, were not always as fraught with peril as might be supposed, and sometimes descended to the ridiculous. The day after being driven from Calella, Catalonia, on August 14, 1808, for instance, French troops returned to greet the crew of the Cyane with light arms and insults. For Tapson, the most striking insult was delivered by a daring French cavalry officer, who exhibited ""a singular display of personal daring, and contempt of danger; for he walked deliberately down to the water's edge with his arms folded over his chest, then turned his Back towards the Ship, and with the utmost 'Sang Froid,' threw the skirt of this Coat over his head, stooped forward & slapped his Hands on a certain part (which is sometimes called the seat of honor) with all the contempt & scorn of our power it was possible by such means to convey"" (p. 36). Captain Staines of the Cyane took the insult personally on behalf of all of the sailors, and assuming personal command of a twelve pounder, exchanged shots with the Frenchman. Frightened, but undaunted, the French officer saw fit ""to continue his indecent exhibition with redoubled energy"" until on the third shot, the Captain's aim proved true. Tapson was repelled by the brutality of the Spanish troops, as much as he was critical of their inefficacy compared to the French. Of a like mind, Captain Staines ordered his men ashore to rally the Spaniards, and to assist in driving off the French rifles. Clearly more comfortable at sea than on land, Staines quickly withdrew, narrowly avoiding capture. ; In May, 1809, the Cyane proceeded to the Bay of Naples, landing at Monte Cecilia to capture a pair of ill-equipped, lightly defended martello towers, and remaining in the region for over two months, intercepting shipping and interrupting land operations whenever possible. In one particularly violent clash with Neapolitan ships during the summer, the Cyane lost 3 men, 27 injured. Among the injured was Capt. Staines, whose arm was shattered by grape shot. He withstood the pain well, according to Tapson, even requesting while his arm was being amputated that the ring on the little finger be carefully preserved. ; In October, 1809, the Cyane returned to England. Tapson awaited his next appointment until June, 1810, when he was made purser to the H.M.S.  Africaine, captained by the sadistic Robert Corbet.

It documents many branches of the family.  ; William Whittemore (b. 1761) of Boston, Massachusetts, wrote several of the earliest letters to his brother Amos in London, England, in the late 1790s.  These letters primarily pertain to their business producing wool and cotton cards, and address such topics as business difficulties and market conditions in Massachusetts.  Other items mention family matters and news, such as the death of their father, Thomas Whittemore (October 10, 1799).  Also present are several letters concerning the Hubbard family of New Haven, Connecticut.  In a letter to his parents, Thomas Hubbard shared his impressions of Georgetown, South Carolina, which he called a ""wicked part"" of the world (December 9, 1798).  He described his living situation in a ""bachelor hall,"" and referenced his wish to ""make a fortune"" in the South.  ; In the late 1830s, the focus of the correspondence series shifts to William Whittemore Low (1823-1877), the grandson of William Whittemore.  The series, which includes both incoming and outgoing letters, documents many aspects of Low's career with the navy.  In several early letters, his relatives strongly discouraged him from enlisting:  His mother requested that he remain near her (August 9, 1839), and his  grandfather wrote, ""You will rue the day, should you enter either the Navy or Merchant Service,"" recommending instead that he become a shopkeeper or lawyer (December 1, 1839).  Accompanying these are several recommendations from friends of Low's character and fitness for service.  For the period of the 1840s and 1850s, many of the items are orders transferring Low between ships or addressing the logistics of his service.  Included is a response to Low's request for detachment from the schooner Graham, signed by Jefferson Davis in his role as U.S. Secretary of War (June 8, 1853).  ; Of particular interest are the letters that Low wrote during his Civil War service as commander of the gunboat Octorara from September 1863 to the end of the war.  They include a large number of long letters home, some giving excellent descriptions of Low's activities in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron.  In a letter dated October 30, 1863, written to his brother Henry, Low anticipated his duties at Mobile but worried, ""I am very much afraid that we shall break down before operations commence.""  In a letter to his father several days later, he gave a good description of the features of the Octorara and noted the repairs made on it (November 11, 1863).  ; A few letters during the Civil War period describe engagements and dangers faced onboard the Octorara.  These include an account of an engagement on Mobile Bay on the morning of August 5, 1864, in which the Octorara fired on a Confederate ship ""at anchor on the West side of the Bay in 2 fathoms water"" (August 29, 1864).  In an additional letter, Low described an incident in which he and his men mistook a ship for the CSS Nashville but quickly realized their error (September 14, 1864).  Incoming letters to Low also shed light on the naval threat of the Confederacy.  They include a copy of a letter by Edward La Croix, warning that a torpedo boat ""propelled by a small engine"" had just been built by Confederates at Selma, Alabama (November 20, 1864), and two letters by naval officer Edward Simpson, conveying intelligence concerning the blockade runner Heroine (March 23, 1865) and discussing the aftermath of the torpedoing of the USS Osage (March 29, 1865).  In the latter, Simpson wrote, ""I feel deeply for those poor fellows from the Osage and had already resolved on appropriating…one of the tin clads for hospital purposes.""  He also expressed hope that surgeons could transport the injured without inflicting further harm on them.; A few letters also discuss the logistics of administering oaths of allegiance to southerners.  ; Also addressed in Low's Civil War correspondence are fairly routine matters, such as leaves of absences (July 2, 1864), complaints about the system of promotions (July 30, 1864), and a letter relating to the court martial of John Kennedy of the USS Oneida, who was found guilty of treating a superior officer with contempt (June 16, 1864).  The series also includes official navy correspondence.  Circular letters and orders address such topics as the use of alcohol onboard ships (September 16, 1862), appropriate actions in neutral waters (June 20, 1863), and the retrieval of supplies from Key West, Florida (September 11, 1863).  Letters concerning Low's postwar career are much scarcer, but of particular interest is an 11-page description by Fred Patter of the capture of the pirate ship Forward (June 19, 1870).; From the 1870s on, the focus of the collection shifts to William W. Low's daughter, Grace Bonticou Low, and several other family members.  Incoming letters to Grace Low begin in 1873, and her uncle, Henry Whittemore Low, and mother, Evelina P. Low, wrote much of the earliest correspondence of this period.  Grace’s outgoing correspondence began in 1880 with letters to her family in New Haven about her time in Washington, D.C., where she attended a co-educational school and participated in ice skating, a tour and reception at the White House (Jan. 4, 1881), a reception of the First Lady Lucy Webb Hayes (Jan. 15, 1881), and visits to the Smithsonian Institution.  Among her female acquaintances was Frances (""Fanny"") Hayes, the daughter of President and Mrs. Hayes.  In the mid-1880s, Low attended school in Watervliet, New York,  and wrote of her social life and classes there.  Her outgoing correspondence ends in 1891.  Approximately 100 letters to Grace Low from her brother, Theodore H. Low, date from the mid-1890s to 1939.  These regard his time at various naval hospitals in South Carolina, Rhode Island, and Washington D.C.  Grace also received around 20 letters from another brother, William Low (1912-1916).  Also of interest are letters written to Henry Low, mostly by his nephews, William and Theodore Low.  Their correspondence with him includes accounts of their service with the Marines during the Boxer rebellion, Philippine insurrection, and the invasion of several Caribbean countries in 1907-1908.  Theodore's later letters provide details of his work as an inventor, including applying for and receiving a patent for a bottle opener. ; Several additional sets of letters provide insights into various female members of the Whittemore, Low, and Parmelee families.  Geraldine Whittemore Low wrote a handful of letters to her uncle, Henry W. Low, from New Haven about her recreational activities and social gatherings with friends during the 1880s.  They concern Valentine’s Day, her whist club, weddings, balls, and other social events.  A set of 30 letters from Julie Parmelee Marston and Mary Parmelee Low, the widow of William Whittemore Low, Jr., to their cousin, Mary E. Redfield in New Haven, relate to their trip to Switzerland between September 1923 and August, 1926.  They traveled on the American Line, SS Mongolia, and after their arrival, explored Switzerland, France, and Italy.  Both Mary and Julie described their surroundings, cultural events they attended, and the people that they met in Europe.  Mary also wrote about her two children, Charlotte and Billy; the expenses of the trip; and several aspects of the children’s education while in Switzerland. ; The "

The earliest William W. Low letter book spans July 25, 1840-March 19, 1867 and contains 415 letters in its 466 pages.  It comprises copies and originals of both incoming and outgoing letters that document much of Low's naval career.  Early letters shed light on Low's time onboard the Missouri and the Saratoga and his education at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.  Many pertain to transfers, ship inventories, orders, and the enlistment of crews.  Of particular interest are letters from the period of Low's service with the Union Navy during the Civil War onboard the St. Louis, Constellation, andOctorara.  Both official and personal in nature, they shed light on naval policies, personnel, and Low's wartime experiences.; A significant part of the postwar correspondence relates to a bureaucratic error which resulted in the delay of a promotion for Low from the Board of Admirals.  An index appears at the end of the volume.; The second William W. Low, Sr., letter book spans 1865-1875, and contains 212 pages of copied incoming and outgoing letters as well as copied passages from books concerning military science and ordnance, and copies of general orders.  The materials pertain to the transportation of supplies, Low's knowledge of ordnance, a proposed article concerning Low for the Army & Navy Journal, Low's recommendations for various navy colleagues, and other subjects.  ; The third William W. Low, Sr., letter book spans 1870-1871, and consists of 335 letters within 263 pages.  It comprises writer-retained copies of outgoing letters to correspondents in the U.S. Navy.  Low wrote the letters while onboard the steam sloop-of-war USS Mohican.  His primary correspondents were Rear Admiral John A. Winslow, S.W. Gordon, Rear Admiral Thomas Turner, Commodore William Rogers Taylor, and George M. Robeson.  Topics of the correspondence include health and sanitation, supplies, the condition of the ship, the ventilation of the berth deck, and navy financial matters.  Low also included in his letters summaries of courts martial for theft, intoxication, and the escape of prisoners, as well as information on casualties, training, and transfers.  A series of significant letters in June 1870 record a conflict between San Salvador and Mexico, as well as the capture of the pirate ship Forward.; Also included is a volume of compiled circular letters from the U.S. Navy Department, 1870-1875.  Likely kept by William W. Low, Sr., the item contains printed and manuscript letters concerning such topics as courts martial, recordkeeping, uniform regulations, and rank.  The book also includes an index of topics in the front.; The first Elisha Peck letter book covers 1843-1863 and contains 30 letters by Peck, most of which he wrote to his wife Grace and children, Evelina (""Eva""), Henry, and Joanna (""Anna"").  Peck wrote 11 of the letters while onboard the U.S. sloop of war Portsmouth from 1849-1851; during this time, Peck commanded the ship as part of an effort to stop the illicit slave trade from West Africa.  In his letters home, he described terrain that he saw from the ship, expressed his sorrow over being separated from his family, and gave accounts of his experiences.  On January 1, 1850, he wrote a letter from Cape Verde, noting that most American and British ships of war took ""on board 20 or 30 African Negroes"" to row in the ""extreme heat of the African sun.""  He also gave details on the evasive movements of slave traders.  In other letters, Low discussed Ghezo, the King of Dahomey and the kingdom's corps of female soldiers (April 20, 1850); the transportation of beeswax and ivory to the coast of present-day Angola (September 1, 1850); and drinking 100-year old wine on Christmas Day (January 2, 1851).  Peck wrote most of the remainder of the letters while onboard the Carolina off the Brooklyn Navy Yard, discussing naval happenings and social visits and expressing affection for his children.  ; The second Elisha Peck letter book contains writer-retained copies of official naval correspondence written by Peck to various correspondents.  The volume spans June 12, 1849-September 1, 1851, and covers the period of Peck's service with the Portsmouth.  Letters concern personnel matters, the compiling of returns, disciplinary matters, and other topics.  Major recipients include Francis Gregory, William B. Preston, William Craig, and William A. Graham. ; Note: Two additional letter books by Thomas J. Whittemore are located in the Genealogy series because they contain correspondence related only to family research.; The "

Peck first went to sea around 1803 as a cabin-boy on the brig Argus.  He worked as a merchant until his arrest by the British in London in 1812, at which time he was pressed into British naval service.  After his exchange in July 1813, he began his career with the United States Navy, acting as master's mate on Gunboat 93.  During his time with the U.S. Navy, which spanned over 40 years, Peck rose up its ranks, eventually reaching the rank of captain.  He served on numerous ships, including the United States, Macedonian, Franklin, Brandywine, Java, Delaware, Falmouth, Dolphin, Natchez, and Grampus.  In 1849, he commanded the USS Portsmouth in an effort to intercept ships involved in the illegal slave trade with West Africa.  In 1855, he was put on the reserve list at the rank of captain.  He died on June 11, 1866.  ; Peck married Grace Bonticou (b. 1805), daughter of James Bonticou and Joanna Clark, on June 14, 1831.

Low's daughter, Grace Bonticou Low, and several other family members.  Incoming letters to Grace Low begin in 1873, and her uncle, Henry Whittemore Low, and mother, Evelina P. Low, wrote much of the earliest correspondence of this period.  Grace’s outgoing correspondence began in 1880 with letters to her family in New Haven about her time in Washington, D.C., where she attended a co-educational school and participated in ice skating, a tour and reception at the White House (Jan. 4, 1881), a reception of the First Lady Lucy Webb Hayes (Jan. 15, 1881), and visits to the Smithsonian Institution.  Among her female acquaintances was Frances (""Fanny"") Hayes, the daughter of President and Mrs. Hayes.  In the mid-1880s, Low attended school in Watervliet, New York,  and wrote of her social life and classes there.  Her outgoing correspondence ends in 1891.  Approximately 100 letters to Grace Low from her brother, Theodore H. Low, date from the mid-1890s to 1939.  These regard his time at various naval hospitals in South Carolina, Rhode Island, and Washington D.C.  Grace also received around 20 letters from another brother, William Low (1912-1916).  Also of interest are letters written to Henry Low, mostly by his nephews, William and Theodore Low.  Their correspondence with him includes accounts of their service with the Marines during the Boxer rebellion, Philippine insurrection, and the invasion of several Caribbean countries in 1907-1908.  Theodore's later letters provide details of his work as an inventor, including applying for and receiving a patent for a bottle opener. ; Several additional sets of letters provide insights into various female members of the Whittemore, Low, and Parmelee families.  Geraldine Whittemore Low wrote a handful of letters to her uncle, Henry W. Low, from New Haven about her recreational activities and social gatherings with friends during the 1880s.  They concern Valentine’s Day, her whist club, weddings, balls, and other social events.  A set of 30 letters from Julie Parmelee Marston and Mary Parmelee Low, the widow of William Whittemore Low, Jr., to their cousin, Mary E. Redfield in New Haven, relate to their trip to Switzerland between September 1923 and August, 1926.  They traveled on the American Line, SS Mongolia, and after their arrival, explored Switzerland, France, and Italy.  Both Mary and Julie described their surroundings, cultural events they attended, and the people that they met in Europe.  Mary also wrote about her two children, Charlotte and Billy; the expenses of the trip; and several aspects of the children’s education while in Switzerland. ; The "
122,umich-wcl-M-2440whi,whittemorelow_final.xml,Finding Aid for Whittemore-Low Family Papers,Death,1,scopecontent,"             contains 12 volumes kept by various family members between 1820 and 1886.  The series consists of two volumes by Grace Bonticou Peck (1820 and 1827), two by William W. Low, Sr. (1844-1845 and [1848-1849]), one by Evelina Peck (1852-1853), one by Henry S. Parmelee (1865), one by Grace B. Low (1886), and five unattributed volumes.  ; Grace B. Peck's two volumes contain poems and quotations selected for or dedicated to her by various friends.  The entries address subjects such as religion, hope, death, friendship, love, solitude, and the qualities of women.  Most of the entries are signed, although few are dated or indicate location.  The books kept by William W. Low, Sr., include an early commonplace book and a logbook for the USS Mohican.  The latter volume comprises daily entries recording weather, barometer readings, sails set, the use of steam power, and the ship's longitude and latitude.  The entries also contain records of minor transgressions, desertions, courts martial, and punishments.  Detailed descriptions of the geography of Mazatlan, Altata, Pichilingue Bay, and San Blas, Mexico, are present on pages 35-41.  The logbook also records the arrivals and departures of foreign ships and shore parties, the receipt of food and supplies, and the transfer of sailors between ships and to hospitals.  Of particular interest is the description of the Mohican's engagement with the pirate ship Forward on June 16-19, 1870 (pages 58-61).  The Evelina Peck volume is an album of messages from various friends and acquaintances, including quotations and several original poems.  Most of the entries are reminiscences about friendship or expressions of sorrow over an imminent departure.  The majority of entries are signed and dated; many mark ""New Haven"" as their location.  The last entry is an ink drawing of a harp and pipe with no date or signature.  The entries are in no particular order.  Henry S. Parmelee's diary records very brief entries for eight days of Civil War service with the 1st Connecticut Cavalry Regiment in March and April 1865.  Grace Bonticou Low’s diary dates from January to June 1886, and describes her life as a 21-year old woman staying with her aunt Anna and uncle James in Washington, D.C.  Her entries reflect almost entirely on social events, dances, masquerades, visits, theater performances, and church attendance.  She often wrote of particular female friends and of the military men she encountered in Washington.; The "

Items pertain to various lines of the family, including the Whittemores, Lows, Pecks, Bonticous, and Parmelees.  Included are newspaper clippings, pamphlets, manuscript records of birth and death dates for various family members, and miscellaneous material giving biographical information.  Also present are two letterbooks kept by Thomas J. Whittemore on genealogical matters and inquiries. ; The "
124,umich-wcl-M-3359.3woc,wochnac_final.xml,Finding Aid for Charles Wochna Letters,Death,1,scopecontent,"This collection contains 27 letters that Lieutenant Charles Wochna wrote to his parents while serving with the United States Marine Corps in Korea and Japan during the Korean War.  Though only one letter is fully dated (January 1, 1954), the letters cover much of his time abroad.  ; While stationed abroad, Wochna attended artillery training, participated in several amphibious landing exercises, and constructed bunkers.  In their spare time, the American soldiers often played volleyball or other sports.  A few letters, written late in the war, discuss Wochna's anticipation of returning home via Japan; in the March 14 letter is a list of items he wished to be shipped to him, and some sketches of emblems that were on his desired clothing.  In addition to news of life in Korea, he also mentioned taking periods of rest and relaxation in Japan, and reported purchasing souvenirs in both countries.; Wochna occasionally commented directly on military operations, detailing his experiences upon landing on an unidentified beach (May 15), mentioning the proximity of a peace delegation (August 7), and relaying news of recent operations.  In a letter dated June 11, he summarized two schools of thought regarding the presence of American military operations in the country.  Other letters refer to the general progress of the war.  Wochna's correspondence also reflects his ongoing concern for family members and friends who remained in the United States.  He often responded to news of his family, including sadness upon hearing of his grandfather's death (June 14).  Wochna frequently offered advice to his brother Jerry, then a student, and requested news about the current football seasons of the Cleveland Browns, Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and Ohio State Buckeyes.  He attempted to follow the teams while stationed abroad."
