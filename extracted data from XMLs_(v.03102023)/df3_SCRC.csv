He graduated from Dondero High School in 1956 and went onto attend the University of Michigan, where he served as the editor of the Michigan Daily. While a student at the University of Michigan, Hayden became one of the founders of the leftist student organization, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), playing an active role in drafting the group's manifesto called the Port Huron Statement, which sought to create a ""radically new democratic political movement"" in the United States that rejected hierarchy and bureaucracy. He served as President of SDS from 1962-1963. In 1968, Hayden along with seven other demonstrators, referred to as the ""Chicago Eight"" had integral parts in orchestrating protests outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois and were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot that were later dropped on appeal. Hayden is also known for making several trips to North Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War, especially the 1972 trip he made with his future wife, Jane Fonda, whom he married the following year. The couple's son Troy was born on July 7, 1973. Haden and Fonda were instrumental in the production of the documentary, Introduction to the Enemy, which chronicled their travels through North and South Vietnam in the spring of 1974. During this period, Hayden also spearheaded the Indochina Peace Campaign that mobilized dissent against the Vietnam War and demanded unconditional amnesty for draft dodgers. Fonda turned the moniker into the name of her film company that produced movies like F.T.A. and Introduction to the Enemy.,  Hayden entered the political arena in 1976 when he ran for the primary to be a U.S. Senator from California. Despite conducting a spirited campaign, Hayden came in second. He and Fonda then initiated the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which promoted solar energy, environmental protection, and renter rights' policies as well as candidates for local offices. Hayden represented the 44th district in the California State Assembly from 1982 to 1990. He won a seat in the California State Senate in 1992. Though he lost in the Democratic primary for the California gubernatorial race in 1994, Hayden was able to keep his seat in the Senate in the 1996 election. In 1997, he decided to run for mayor of Los Angeles, which he ultimately lost. Hayden thought about entering the race in 2000 to represent the 42nd district in the California State Assembly but reconsidered to campaign to be part of the Los Angeles City Council,which was a battle he ended up losing. He did, however, become the state's first energy official. Throughout his political career, Hayden has strove to make an impact. He has been a champion of many issues from disaster assistance, to safe driving, to Holocaust reparations, to tobacco regulation, to HIV/AIDS programs. Hayden was on the forefront of proposing educational and environmental initiatives, which were two main focuses of his as a legislator. He also contended with matters that emerged while in office like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority strikes that occurred in the 1990s. While Hayden was primarily concerned with problems facing the Californian population, he also showed an interest in global events, particularly in the Israel, Ireland, and El Salvador conflicts.,  In addition to his roles as an activist and politician, Hayden has also written profusely. Some of his books include: Vietnam: The Struggle for Peace, 1972-1973 (1973), The American Future: New Visions beyond Old Frontiers (1980) , Reunion: A Memoir (1988), The Lost Gospel of Earth: A Call for Renewing Nature, Spirit and Politics (1996), Irish Hunger (1997), and Irish on the Inside: A Search of the Soul of Irish America (2001), and Street Wars: Gangs and the Future of Violence (2004). He has also written numerous articles about a host of topics that range from baseball to the Iraq War.,  Another capacity in which Hayen has served has been as an instructor.

Parlaying his fees as a screenwriter of mainstream Hollywood films into funding for his own ambitious filmmaking projects, Sayles created an oeuvre in which the personal and the political intersect at the heart of the American experience.,  The child of educators, Sayles earned a B.A. in psychology from Williams College (1972), where he also acted in plays and began writing fiction. After graduation Sayles supported himself with a variety of blue-collar jobs that broadened his worldview, as did a number of cross-country hitchhiking sojourns. In 1975 he published his first novel, The Pride of the Bimbos, about a cross-dressing barnstorming softball team. A year later he won an O. Henry Award for his short story ""I-80 Nebraska, m.490–m.205,"" and he earned another in 1977 for ""Breed."" Sayles's second novel, Union Dues (1977), which follows a West Virginia miner's search for his son against the backdrop of the tumultuous 1960s, was a finalist for a National Book Award. His short stories from the period were collected in The Anarchist's Convention (1979).,  Sayles wrote his way into the motion-picture industry, using as his calling card a screenplay based on the Black Sox Scandal, which he would eventually direct as Eight Men Out (1988). His early screenwriting efforts—several of which were written for Roger Corman, including Piranha (1978) and Battle Beyond the Stars (1980)—were genre exercises that Sayles loaded with literary and cinematic references. Later for-hire screenwriting projects included The Howling (1981), The Quick and the Dead (1995), and The Alamo (2004). With a paltry $40,000 earned from his writing, Sayles made his directorial debut with Return of the Secaucus 7 (1980), which chronicled the reunion of former college friends who had been activists in the 1960s. The cast, made up primarily of actors with whom Sayles had worked in summer-stock theatre, included his Williams College classmates David Strathairn and Maggie Renzi, who became Sayles's life partner and the producer of most of his films.,  With Return, Sayles began a body of work that proved him to be the heir to the patient, character-driven tradition of independent filmmaking pioneered by John Cassavetes. Sayles's politically aware films often focus on marginalized characters, weave together various strata of society, or examine unfamiliar chapters of U.S. history. Frequently they reveal a failure of American life to deliver on the promise of its national ideals, yet they are almost always leavened with humour and grounded in hope. In addition to writing, directing, and often acting in his films, Sayles also usually edited them himself.,  Wallenfeldt, Jeff. ""John Sayles."" http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Sayles. Retrieved 09-21-2015.,  John Sayles and Maggie Renzi have been creative partners, in their life and in their art, since the early '70s. They met as students at Williams College in Massachusetts. John was a member of the class of 1972 and Maggie was member of the class of 1973. In the years immediately after graduation, Maggie worked as a bookstore clerk, a pediatric receptionist, a substitute teacher, a casting agent and a talent agent, while John took jobs like nursing home orderly and meat packer. In the late '70s they moved to California for a few years. John worked for Roger Corman's New World Pictures, and Maggie worked as a salad chef.,  In 1979 they released their first film: Return of the Secaucus Seven (1979). John wrote the screenplay, and directed and edited the film. He also played the supporting role of Howie', a townie who has three kids before his 30th birthday. Maggie starred as 'Kate', the high school English teacher who invites all her college buddies up to her New Hampshire home for their annual reunion. She also served as Unit Manager and Assistant Editor. The Return of the Secaucus Seven became an art house and campus hit, winning the Los Angeles Film Critics' Award for Best Screenplay, and launching Sayles and Renzi on their way as independent filmmakers.,  Beginning with their second film, Lianna (1983), Maggie assumed the role of Producer. While she continued to act, her producing responsibilities grew on each subsequent film, and she finally decided to focus just on producing after Passion Fish (1992) was released in 1992. She worked as part of a team of producers on the early films, but on the two most recent films Limbo (1999) and Sunshine State (2002), she is credited as sole producer.,  In 2000, Maggie was one of the producers of Girlfight (2000), the award-winning first feature made by Karyn Kusama (who began her film career on Sayles/Renzi production teams). However, Maggie says she is not planning to produce other non-Sayles films.,  IMDb Mini Biography By: Jan Lisa Huttner films42@msn.com. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0719964/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm.

In addition, Dr. Tate donated an extensive collection of serials and monographs relating primarily to the fields of photography, microphotography, and archives.,  The Tate Personal and Professional Papers document Vernon Tate's personal interests and activities along with many aspects of his professional career between 1929 and 1989. This group does not, however, include files from his work as Executive Secretary of the National Microfilm Association. Those materials can be found in the National Microfilm Association Records in this repository.,  Dr. Tate's papers contain correspondence, speeches, articles, meeting minutes, annual reports, newsletters, conference proceedings, press releases, dissertation research materials, and photographic and microphotographic research notes. In addition, the collection contains log books (diaries), which contain his thoughts and notes on his personal and professional activities, although the log books will not be available for research until October 1, 2009.,  Scattered materials concern Tate's activities between 1929 and 1935 as a student, researcher,and microfilmer for the Library of Congress. Included is correspondence, extensive research materials on the port of San Blas (his dissertation topic), and articles on maritime history and photography.,  Large portions of several series concern the years between 1935 and 1946 during which Tate headed the photographic archives and research division of the National Archives and then served in the Navy during World War II. Almost two-thirds of the correspondence series and nearly half of Tate's speeches and writings date from this period. Besides these materials, the files contain inter-office memoranda, literature and notes on microphotography, and notes on his own experiments. Since Tate was the seventh professional staff member hired by the National Archives after its founding in 1935, the files include materials on the early development of the agency and the beginnings of the photographic laboratory and microfilm operation.,  By the mid-1930's Tate was already one of the recognized authorities in the rapidly developing field of microphotography. In addition to his work at the National Archives, the files concern such topics as his work as editor of the Journal of Documentary Reproduction, 1938-1942; the early history of the American Documentation Institute and the Federation Internationale de Documentation; and his involvement in the work of the Microcard Committee. A small amount of correspondence concerns the establishment and early history of the National Microfilm Association, 1944-1946, before Tate became an officer. ,  The amount of material declines significantly for the years after 1946. Materials relating to his work as Director of Libraries at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and subsequently as Librarian and Archivist at the U.S. Naval Academy appear, but they are smaller in quantity and less complete than the materials on earlier years. Although the Tate Papers do not concern his work as an officer of the National Microfilm Association, they do document many professional activities not connected with NMA. Included is material on his various library and archival positions and his involvement with such organizations as the American Documentation Institute and the Federation Internationale de Documentation.,  In addition to documenting many of Tate's professional activities, his papers concern family matters and personal interests. The correspondence series includes a small sequence of family letters exchanged between Tate and his wife, parents, and other relatives. The personal interests series contains information on his hobbies and interests, especially in naval history and other nautical matters, but also in such areas as antiques, art, books and printing, history, and libraries.",,"   Jan. 3, 1909 Born in Mount Carmel, Illinois   1929 Graduated from U.C.L.A.

The 1.5 linear feet of material span the years 1958 to 1988, with the bulk of the papers dating between 1959 and 1962. The Pasternak records of the University of Michigan Press have been divided into three series: Dr. Zhivago (0.5 linear feet), Eugene Kayden Translation -- Poems (1959) (0.5 linear feet), Sochineniia [Collected Works] (1961) (0.5 linear feet), and Media (3 items). ,  The Dr. Zhivago series consists of two subseries: Pre-publication and Publication. Pre-publication includes newspaper clippings related to the Nobel Prize awarded to Pasternak in 1958, correspondence pertaining to the copyright negotiations with Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore, and promotional materials for the book's release. Most of the correspondence to Feltrinelli is carbon copies. Permissions Granted is correspondence between the Press and other authors regarding use of the novel in other publications. These letters date between 1960 and 1988. Additional material includes a limited amount of University of Michigan Press business records, galleys of the text, and other miscellaneous documents. ,  In the Eugene Kayden Translation -- Poems (1959) series much of the material is correspondence from Press directors Glenn Gosling, Ed Watkins, and Robert Erwin. Photographs of letters written to Eugene Kayden from Pasternak are included as well. The photographs are quite legible, and the text is in Russian. Related material, particularly the agreement signed between the Press and Eugene Kayden, is also in this series. Some of the folder dates will overlap in an attempt to maintain the original order of the materials.,  Sochineniia [Collected Works] (1961), the Russian publication of Pasternak's poetry by scholars Gleb Struve and Boris Filippov, is the final series in the collection. Correspondence in this series, dated between 1959 and 1984, is arranged chronologically. A smaller amount of topical correspondence is arranged alphabetically by topic. As is the case with the previous series, some of the folder dates will overlap in an attempt to maintain the collections' original order.,  The Media series contains two microfilms of the Collected Works , and an audiotape copy of the 45rpm vinyl recording of Pasternak Speaks . The tape documents a reading at Pasternak's home in 1958.

In the late 1950s, as a reaction to Cold War era politics, the Press embarked on a program to publish Russian language materials. Their first undertaking was Boris Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago . Although Dr. Zhivago had been published in many languages, it had never before been printed in its original Russian. ,  A lengthy debate began between the Press and two other publishers. Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore, an Italian publisher, claimed to hold copyright as they had published an edition in 1957. In New York City, Pantheon Books, Inc. claimed to hold the rights to publications of the novel in English, having made previous arrangements with Feltrinelli. In February 1959, the Michigan Press entered into a licensing agreement with Feltrinelli and a similar agreement with Pantheon. Michigan was granted the right to distribute the novel in the United States, its territories and dependencies, in Canada, and in all other countries of the Western Hemisphere, the Philippine Islands, and Japan. Feltrinelli would publish in Europe, the Middle East, and all other countries not included in the agreement.,  Subsequent to the Dr. Zhivago publication, the Michigan Press published a translation of Pasternak's poetry. Russian-born Eugene M. Kayden, then an economics professor at the University of the South, undertook the translation.

20,umich-scl-weber,"Edward C. Weber (1922-2006) was long-time curator of the University of Michigan Special Collection's Joseph A. Labadie Collection of radical history. Under his stewardship, the Labadie Collection grew into one of the premier and most forward-thinking holdings of materials relating to radical and protest groups from the United States and around the world. The Edward C. Weber Papers are made up of the subject's correspondence and biographical materials, written from 1949 to 2006. The bulk of the collection, the correspondence is mostly comprised of Weber's letters soliciting materials on behalf of the Labadie Collection or fielding reference questions from researchers, as well as personal correspondence from the his family and friends. The collection's materials are comprised of letters (typed and handwritten), printed out emails, postcards, greeting cards, news clippings, photographs, printed biographical materials, framed commendations, and other miscellaneous paper materials.",The material is in English.,"The Edward C. Weber Papers consists of Weber's correspondence with organizations, publishers, researchers, associates, family, and friends, along with biographical materials created for his retirement and memorial services. The collection provides a snapshot of the Joseph A. Labadie Collection and his work there for a 40 year period (1960-2000), as well as a portrait of his personal relationships with friends and family from 1949 to 2005.,  The Biographical Materials series contains materials from Weber's retirement celebration and memorial service. The first folder contains past articles and correspondence on paper stock, reprinted for Weber's memorial service in 2006. The second set of items relate to Weber's retirement in 2000. This includes a flyer for his retirement celebration, articles about his retirement, and copied certificates of commendation. In addition, two framed items of commendation are housed in an oversized box.,  The Correspondence series makes up the majority of the collection and is comprised of 27 linear feet of paper material housed in 54 manuscript boxes, foldered alphabetically by correspondent or corresponding organization. Individual letters, cards, photographs and other types of written communication are arranged chronologically within each subject's folder(s). The majority of folders are dedicated to outreach by Weber to various radical groups and individuals soliciting material donations to contribute to the Labadie Collection. His written responses to reference inquiries for items within the Labadie Collection make up another significant segment of the series. Most of these materials are typewritten letters officially sent on behalf of the Labadie Collection and University of Michigan Special Collections. Some later letters were written by Labadie Collection assistants during Weber's time there and with his knowledge. Since Weber never used email, his letters sent on behalf of the Labadie Collection were typed on a manual or electric typewriter. There are occasional handwritten notations on some of these letters and a few emails printed out so he could read them. Other folders in the series contain personal correspondence from friends, family, and other associates. These items are made up mostly of handwritten notes, postcards, greeting cards, newspaper clippings, printouts of emails, occasional photographs, and other miscellaneous items. Many of the folders were removed from the general Labadie correspondence files in 2008 and a listing was made of them at that time. The rest of the series is made up of personal correspondence Weber stored in his home.,  Within the series are several notable, lengthy correspondence partners including Theodore Adams (1950-2004, 21 folders), James Q. Belden (1952-2000, 11 folders), George Nick (1949-1991, 12 folders), Curtis and Clarice Rodgers (1961-2005, 18 folders), and Henry Van Dyke (1950-2004, 12 folders). The series also includes correspondence from notable individuals such as civil rights activist Malcolm X, graphic novelist Harvey Pekar, former Secretary of State Eliot Abrams, the White Panther Party, among many others.,  Abbreviations:,  LC=Labadie Collection ECW=Edward C. Weber",,"Longtime curator of the Joseph A. Labadie Collection within the University of Michigan's Special Collections, Edward C. Weber (1922-2006) was a critical figure within the University's library system and an active supporter of various marginalized communities.,  Born September 14, 1922 in Rochester, NY, he earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Rochester followed by a master's degree in American literature from Columbia University. He made his way to the Ann Arbor area to attend the University of Michigan's library school in 1952. While a student, he began working part-time as a reference librarian at the university's Social Science Library. He continued working within the library system after completing his education and became head of the Labadie Collection in 1960 (Daub, 2006).,  A prominent resource within the University of Michigan's Special Collections, the Labadie Collection is the oldest publicly-accessible collection for radical history, containing items from a diverse array of social protest and radical movements that date from the nineteenth to twenty-first centuries. Under Weber's guidance and persistent outreach, the Labadie Collection developed rich holdings for the Sixtie's anti-war, modern anarchism, gay liberation, radical feminism, pacifism, and ecology movements. By actively providing representation to these marginalized communities within the library's holdings, the Labadie Collection was for a period one of the few significant scholarly resources for gay, feminist, and anti-war studies. By the time Weber retired in 2000, the Labadie Collection had grown six-fold and was firmly entrenched as a primary resource for scholarship of the history of radicalism (""History"").,  Besides managing the Labadie Collection, Weber was critical for developing collections regarding Latin American studies, theater, and minority literature for the university's library system (Daub, 2006). In addition to his work within the library, Weber was a proud member of the local Ann Arbor community, participating as manager of the Cinema Guild for 37 years and actively supporting the University Musical Society (Retzloff, 2006).,  Edward Weber passed away at the age of 83 on April 11, 2006.,  References:,  ""History"".

After a time, he became involved in humanitarian causes and rights reform. In 1882, he founded the Indian Rights Association, which was a group of white Pennsylvanians working on behalf of American indigenous peoples. In 1890, he became involved in the fight against political corruption by joining the Civil Service Reform Association of Pennsylvania as well as the National Civil Service Reform League. During his career, he also authored a number of publications discussing the rights of Native Americans with a particular majority concerning the Great Sioux Nation.
