  <bioghist><p>Philip A. Hart was United States Senator from Michigan, serving from 1959 until his death in December of 1976. Born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania on December 10, 1912, Hart graduated from Georgetown University in 1934 and the University of Michigan Law School in 1937. He practiced law in Detroit for four years until the outbreak of war when he enlisted in the United States Army. He served until 1946, and was wounded during the D-Day assault on Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion.</p><p> Following the war, Hart returned to the law and embarked on a career in public service. His law school classmate Governor G. Mennen Williams appointed him to the Michigan Corporation Securities Commission (1949-1951); he served as state director of the Office of Price Stabilization (1951-1952), and as United States district attorney of the Eastern Michigan District (1952-1953). As Williams established himself as governor, he relied increasingly on the demonstrated abilities of Hart, serving as his legal advisor (1953-1954), and as lieutenant governor (1955-1958).</p><p> In 1958 Hart was elected to the United States Senate where he served for eighteen years, winning decisive reelections in 1964 and again in 1970. Poor health decided Hart against running for reelection in 1976. He died December 26, 1976, a few weeks from completing his third full term.</p><p> As Senator, Hart earned the reputation of being an honest, hard-working, and conscientious spokesman for the policies and programs of the Democratic party and for liberal Democratic causes in general. When he first came to the Senate, Hart was appointed to two committees: Agriculture and Forestry, and Judiciary. He remained a member of the Judiciary throughout his three terms in the Senate, serving as chairman of its subcommittees on antitrust and monopoly and refugees and escapees in addition to being a member of various other subcommittees relating to immigration, juvenile delinquency, and patents and copyrights. With less interest in matters of agriculture, Hart in 1963 shifted over to the Commerce Committee, where he came to serve as chairman of its subcommittee on energy, natural resources and environment (name later changed to environment) and vice chairman of its consumer affairs subcommittee. Beyond responsibilities associated with these two committees, Hart was member at various times of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, and the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities among others.</p><p> Although he was a sponsor or key sponsor of many pieces of legislation, Hart himself was proudest of his work as floor manager of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Open Housing-Civil Rights Bill, his championing of the legislation to make Michigan's Sleeping Bear Dunes and Pictured Rocks national lakeshores, and his sponsorship of consumer-related legislation (e.g. truth-in-packaging, truth-in-lending, and truth-in-spending).</p></bioghist>

  <scopecontent><p>The Philip A. Hart collection consists of those files maintained by Hart and his staff in Washington D.C. while serving as senator from Michigan in the period 1958-1976. A senate office in the 1960s and 1970s could employ as many as thirty staff and clerical workers. In 1975, Hart wrote: "My own office presently consists of 34 full-time people in Washington plus 4 in my Detroit office and one part-time employee each in Grand Rapids and Marquette." Received from Washington, the Hart collection documents the workings of his Capitol office. Excepting for a few files from the 1950s when Hart served in Michigan state government, the Hart papers relate exclusively to Senate activities and detail the variety and bulk of problems crossing the desk of a United States senator and his staff.</p><p> In a press release describing his office, Hart stated that the work of a senator falls into three categories: legislative, participating in the discussion and formulation of public policy, and serving as "ambassador" between his constituents and the Federal Government. Beyond the study of legislation, public policy debates, and the relationship between a senator and the people of his state, the Hart collection is a reflection of the times in which Hart served, the sixties and seventies, years of the presidencies of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford, a time when public figures discussed issues of conscience and of war, matters of human rights and of public morality, areas where Hart's basic integrity and humaneness placed him in the forefront of public debate.</p><p> The collection falls into eleven principal series: Personal/Biographical, Legislative Files, Staff Files, Press Files, Subject Files, Constituent Correspondence, Office Files, Political Files, Miscellaneous, Sound Recordings, and Visual Materials. Except for Personal/Biographical and the series of audio-visual materials, the Hart collection is an office file and represents the activities of one senator and a dozen or so of his key staff members. To use the collection, the researcher after examining the "Series Description" (on the following pages) should note that for any topical study, information will usually be found in any number of series within the collection. The series represent functional divisions within the Hart office, legislation, press, or whatever. To study an issue such as consumer protection, therefore, the researcher should be prepared to examine the Hart finding aid under the series that might document that topic from different functional perspectives (Legislative Files, Staff Files, Subject Files, among others). The researcher interested in a narrower, more specific topic should recognize that the following inventory, for the most part, is not a folder-level description and thus specialized kinds of information will be filed first under a more general heading.</p><p> One more note: The Hart papers originally consisted of more than 700 linear feet of files. Hart himself and his staff had discarded certain types of files before donating them to the library, notably case files and constituent mail answered by form. In addition, the library discarded files of low research content - thank yous, invitations, and carbons of Hart correspondence duplicated in the other principal series of the collection. Furthermore, files containing similar types of correspondence from constituents have been sampled (the folders have "S" or "Samp" on them). Government publications, easily available in a government documents library, and unless heavily annotated, have been discarded. Researchers on any topic within the Hart collection should familiarize themselves with the standard sources on government documents (the indices to the Congressional Record for example). Topics on which Hart played a key legislative role or about which he was keenly interested have not been sampled. These topics include civil rights, the passage of various consumer legislation, the Sleeping Bear Dunes debate, his committee work, and the debate over the war in Vietnam to list a few.</p></scopecontent>

"Bills" is by far the largest subseries, consisting of fifty-five linear feet of materials. The first grouping of files within "Bills" is arranged alphabetically by broad subject headings (Agriculture, Education, Labor, etc.) and covers the years 1959-1962. Beginning in 1963, the Hart office adopted a yearly arrangement scheme for the series based upon Senate and House bill numbers. To use this portion of the files efficiently, the researcher will need to determine the House or Senate number of a piece of legislation (through the Digest of public general bills and resolutions available in the Documents Center of the University of Michigan Graduate Library or any Federal Repository Library.). The size of each legislative file varies with the amount of constituent mail it generated.</p><p> The other subseries within the Legislative Files are considerably smaller but not without substance. "Legislation co-sponsored" consists of communications between Hart and other members of the Senate regarding co-sponsorship of legislation. The files are divided between yes and no, and frequently include the rationale for his decision whether or not to co-sponsor a specific bill. The "Committees" subseries consists of Hart's working files from his different Senate committee assignments The size of the files for any given year varies with the level of power Hart exercised within the committee. Thus, the researcher will find considerably more information about the Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee and Environment Subcommittee because Hart served as chairman. The "Miscellaneous" subseries includes Hart's voting record within the Senate, information about the legislation Hart introduced or co-sponsored, and summaries of Hart's speeches and debates on the Senate floor as they appeared in the Congressional Record. The last subseries within Legislative Files has two parts: "Correspondence with members of Congress" and "Correspondence with government officials, organizations, and other public figures." Both sets of files are arranged alphabetically and include general types of communications (thank yous, requests, congratulations, etc.) as well as letters about legislation, politics, and the state of the nation. For the researcher interested in a specific public figure, this might be one place to begin, but always keeping in mind that correspondence with that individual might also be found elsewhere in the collection.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_d972f770486059050f7ac0e4edef3456" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Bills</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_6b0c2a20bb6ad91b24860d8f6ed2f14b"

Because of the complexity of legislative issues and constituent concerns, Hart had a staff of 7-10 people with another dozen or so working with the thousands of letters received each week and on other clerical tasks. This series consists of the files of many of the senior Hart staff, those with specific legislative or administrative responsibilities. Included are Hart's first administrative assistant, William B. Welch, his legislative counsel Donald F. Tucker, special assistant John M. (Jack) Cornman, legislative assistant Muriel Ferris among others. A complete list of individuals with papers in the Hart papers will be found in the Summary Contents List. A partial listing of all Hart staff members together with area of responsibility will be found in the Biographical/Personal series (box 1; folder, "Hart staff miscellanea/assignments").</p><p> Because Hart relied so heavily on his staff, this series documents those issues and pieces of legislation about which Hart was most concerned. Included here are memoranda between Hart and his staff about the drafting of legislation and the strategy to be used in reaching a consensus so that any given bill might become law. Worthy of special mention is a subseries composed of the working files of various staff members. Arranged alphabetically, this subseries consists of memoranda, reports, and documents arranged topically. Large portions of this subseries relate to the amnesty issue, the Sleeping Bear Dunes and Pictures Rocks national parks legislation, the debate over control of automobile emissions, and the Seafarer/Sanguine project. An important part of this subseries is files of memoranda arranged chronologically on legislation and other public policy issues.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_e5e7f002f7599da98d724ecb70aee886" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>William B.

differently from the rest of the Hart staff files. The Press Office series consists of five major subseries: "Press releases and newsletters," "Speeches," "Newspaper clippings," "Subject files" and "Schedules." Except for the "Subject files," each of the subseries has been arranged chronologically. The first two subseries are comprised of mimeographed releases of press notices, newsletters, and speeches given. "Clippings" consists of newspaper clippings compiled by a professional clipping service about Hart and his congressional activities. This series reflects and documents Hart's image of himself and the image that the print media had of him. The "Subject files" comprise press releases, memoranda, drafts, and other information maintained by Hart's press secretary Jerry Kabel. These files are arranged alphabetically by broad subject heading and should be used to complement other subject files within the collection.</p></scopecontent><c02

Though Subject Files is a constituent file, it is different from the Constituent Correspondence (described below) in that here there are detailed and individual responses from Hart or the appropriate government agency to citizen concerns. The files are arranged chronologically (except for the first five years of his tenure which is one alphabetical subseries), and then alphabetically by subject. The subject headings are broad, then further subdivided into specific subheadings. A typical kind of document exchange might include a letter from a constituent expressing a concern about a government service or the need for more or less government regulation or legislation. Hart and his staff respond to the letter, and where appropriate pass the letter along to the appropriate agency. The agency then responds to the constituent and includes a copy of the response for Hart and his files. Subject Files is different from Constituent Correspondence in that fewer form letters are used as responses and that the response is a specific reply to a concern and not usually a general statement of Hart's position on various issues.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_5ef65f2e3486b9efb918fbc0df94253b" level="subseries"><did><unitdate normal="1959/1964" type="inclusive">1959-1964</unitdate></did><c03 id="aspace_324e41171c1c286fcbb065e4524210d5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Agriculture</unittitle></did><c04 id="aspace_423e22077a0feb50eb4a3e24bbd9e41a" level="file"><did><unittitle>ACP Huron County</unittitle><unitdate normal="1961/1962" type="inclusive">1961-1962</unitdate><container label="Box" type="box">134</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_5657ae591ffe804e29795d74bb5b5ae9" level="file"><did><unittitle>ACP Service</unittitle><unitdate normal="1961/1961" type="inclusive">1961</unitdate><container label="Box" type="box">134</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_b71f6c9aca8ac9b9f4e505483fab3d86" level="file"><did><unittitle>ASC Comm.

and intensity of Hart's constituents to the issues of the day. Depending upon the issue, the Hart office often received many thousands of letters urging Hart to vote yea or nay on some controversial piece of legislation. So voluminous was the senator's mail that beginning in 1966, he discarded the letters, keeping instead a record of the letters he received on any given issue. The files up through 1965 have been heavily sampled to provide a sense of what issues exercised his constituents. A more useful portion of this series is the form response that Hart used to reply to his constituents and the files of mail counts.</p><p> Files for 1958-1959 are arranged by topic or legislative subject.

Office Files now consists of three subseries: "General Files", "Administration" and "Publicity." "General Files" covers the period of 1959 through 1969 after which time the files seem to have merged with the "Administration" subseries which covers the period of 1959 to 1976. The kinds of documents originally contained in these two subseries included: recommendations requested for Washington jobs; PAH's acknowledgments of persons' graduations, anniversaries, birthdays, etc.; requests for flags to fly over the Capitol; requests for travel courtesy; requests for PAH to meet with visitors in Washington; requests from constituents for the Agricultural Yearbook, the Congressional Record, speeches made by PAH in Congress, and reports of government agencies; letters from applicants for intern positions or for positions as Capitol pages; and requests for Hart to use his influence to get other politicos to make speeches and/or public appearances. These series also included Hart's request to use rooms in the Capitol. These files have been heavily sampled, and in some cases, discarded completely. The researcher should note that in 1970, the year the "General Files" and "Administration" subseries merged, the character of the files changed significantly with many of the file headings disappearing altogether. Obviously in 1970, Hart and his staff either discarded or had microfilmed and then discarded letters and requests of a routine nature. Some of the more interesting files in the "Administration" subseries relate to staff operations and office administration. Here there are individual files for staff members containing correspondence and memoranda. The third subseries in the Office Files series is "Public Relations." Formerly a subseries under "Administration" series (called Administration - Publicity), around 1970, the files were split off from "Administration" and a separate series - "Public Relations" - was created. Types of files in the now "Public Relations" subseries include responses to Hart mailings (newsletters) or responses to his radio and TV appearances.</p></scopecontent><c02

There is about one linear foot of slides and photographs arranged by subject matter. In addition, this series includes one oversize folder of political cartoons given to Hart over the course of his career, nine linear feet of motion picture films (approximately 100 reels) with different subject matter, and a small videotape subseries. Some of the films have use copies as well as negative and sound reels. In addition to ten 2-inch video tapes, the Videotape subseries includes a videotape compilation of the film clips relating to the proposed Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore or Pictured Rock Lakeshore. This tape consists mainly of brief, 2-3 minute, "messages" filmed at the U.S. Senate television/film studio, but also several longer interviews. The first three segments on this tape are positive prints, the others are "lavender" negatives (a copy negative rather than original camera negative). The negative film was electronically converted to positive image on the videotape. All have optical sound on film.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_6f3337b39c7dd5c4b20859cdb62b785c" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Slides and
