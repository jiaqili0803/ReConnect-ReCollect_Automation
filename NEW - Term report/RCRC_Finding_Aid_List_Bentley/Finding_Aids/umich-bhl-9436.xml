  <bioghist><p>Harry Hill Bandholtz, a lifelong military man, was born in Constantine, Michigan on December 18, 1864. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1890, and then for the next thirty-three years he served his country in more than a dozen different assignments and posts. Bandholtz early demonstrated his competence as an officer with leadership abilities, and he was continuously rewarded with a steady series of promotions to different challenging assignments. He was a front-line officer, a teacher of the military arts, an administrator within the military hierarchy, and a skilled and respected diplomat.</p><p> Following some early assignments, Bandholtz in 1896 was selected to teach military science and tactics at Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University). He was a teacher for two years when, with the outbreak of war with Spain in 1898, he returned to active duty. In Cuba he served in the Santiago campaign with the 7th U.S. Infantry, receiving a Silver Star citation for his participation. Between 1898 and 1900, he held different positions in the United States and Cuba. In July 1900, he left Cuba for the Philippine Islands where he served for the next thirteen years. Bandholtz' first responsibility was to help establish peace in the Islands which was then being disturbed by various local insurgent armies, notably in Central Luzon and on the Island of Marinduque and in Tayabas Province.</p><p> Bandholtz quickly earned the respect of the Philippine people. In 1902, he was elected governor of Tayabas Province, the only regular army officer to be elected to so high a position. In 1903, he was appointed assistant chief of Philippine Constabulary with the temporary rank of colonel and placed in command of the District of Southern Luzon. Bandholtz was an effective commander who arranged for the unconditional surrender of insurgent general Simeon Ola and his forces in Albay. In 1905, he was transferred to the District of Central Luzon where he similarly apprehended Philippine bandit leaders. In 1907, he was appointed chief of Philippine Constabulary with the temporary rank of brigadier general. He held this position until relieved on September 1, 1913.</p><p> Upon returning to the United States, Bandholtz was put in command of Fort Porter at Buffalo, New York (1914-1915) and a battalion of the 30th Infantry at Plattsburg Barracks, N.Y. (1915-1916). With this command, he served on the Mexican border for six months in 1916. During World War I, Bandholtz served on the Western Front, receiving promotion to brigadier general with command of the 58th Infantry Brigade of the 29th Division. In September 1918, General Pershing appointed Bandholtz to be provost marshal general of the American Expeditionary Forces where his duties included reorganizing the military police corps and managing the guarding of German prisoners of war.</p><p> From August 1919 to February 1920, Bandholtz served as American representative on the Interallied Military Mission sent to Hungary by the Supreme Council to control the unauthorized Rumanian occupation of that country. Bandholtz later served as the first United States Commissioner to Hungary. He returned to the United States in 1920, receiving promotion to permanent brigadier general with command of the 13th Infantry Brigade at Camps Funston and Meade. In August 1921, Bandholtz was assigned the duty of organizing and commanding the newly authorized District of Washington. Shortly thereafter, he was sent to West Virginia when the state authorities requested federal aid in maintaining the peace during a strike of coal miners. Bandholtz retired from military service in 1923 with the rank of major general. He died in his hometown of Constantine, May 7, 1925.</p></bioghist>
  <scopecontent><p>The Bandholtz collection, covering the period of ca. 1890 to 1925 (with some later papers of his wife Inez Bandholtz), consists mainly of materials accumulated while Bandholtz was stationed in the Philippines, 1900-1913. Except for this time in the Far East, Bandholtz was always on the move with ever changing assignments, and consequently his files covering his work on the Mexican border, for example, or in the West Virginia coal miners strike are substantially thinner. But in the Philippines, because he was a provincial governor and head of the indigenous military force, Bandholtz was at the center of affairs in this period of Philippine history. And beyond that, he made an effort to maintain and preserve as much documentation from his service here as he could.</p><p> The Bandholtz papers came to the library in three separate accessions in 1965, 1994 and 2005. The first accession includes the following series: Correspondence (1899-1913), Invitations, Miscellaneous, Published Materials, and Philippine Constabulary Reports (1906-1913). The second accession includes the following series: Biographical-Personal, Correspondence (1895-1925), Diaries (1900-1923), Topical Files, Visual Materials, Scrapbooks, and Inez Bandholtz papers. Although there is some overlap (especially in the two Correspondence series), the two accessions have been kept separate, and not interfiled, so that researchers who examined the first accession might read from the new material without having to go through the entire collection. This encoded finding aid treats the correspondence as a single series although it has not been interfiled. the third accession consists of correspondence (1903-1912), chiefly confidential letters between Bandholtz and Luke Wright and Leonard Wood, concerning major military an political issues in the Philippines.</p></scopecontent>

Volume 1 (dated 1906-1909) in fact dates back to 1898 and consists entirely of reports and memoranda concerning the Japan-Philippine Island relationship. Groupings of documents within this volume bear the title "Compilation of Papers on Japanese Propagandism." There is a partial index to the contents of this volume at the end. Volume 2 (1910), Volume 3 (1911), and Volume 4 (1912-June 1913) continue the memoranda and reports of the first volume and the theme of Japanese involvement in the Philippines.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_896aebbadc5b032f662e9fedaba21a92" level="file"><did><unitdate normal="1906/1913-06" type="inclusive">1906-June 1913</unitdate><container label="Roll" type="reel">6</container></did></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_4f7c787615eebc4fa25ea373498a19e1" level="series"><did><unittitle>Biographical Material/personal</unittitle></did><c02 id="aspace_82720b638bd64590b31f6b3592e1e425" level="file"><did><unittitle>Biographical sketches, service record, clippings, etc</unittitle><container label="Roll" type="reel">7</container></did><odd><p>(see also citation in UAm oversize folder)</p></odd></c02><c02 id="aspace_390b79690b5ef33a2b1b7d1c572bb2d8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Family Miscellanea (including earlier letters from family members)</unittitle><container label="Roll" type="reel">7</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_cfdf250ba74ce5d8b175f499e62b557e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Address books</unittitle><container label="Roll" type="reel">7</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_f58b89cc4624e2c40b40880dba175af7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Speeches</unittitle><container label="Roll" type="reel">7</container></did></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_870a37cdbc6be855d1bb72efe828d084" level="series"><did><unittitle><genreform normal="Diaries">Diaries</genreform></unittitle><physdesc><extent>23 volumes</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1900/1923" type="inclusive">1900-1923</unitdate></did><scopecontent><p>Diaries (1900-1923; 23 volumes) contains Bandholtz' often detailed comments on his life as a career officer.
