  <bioghist><p>The history of the U-M Herbarium goes back to the November 18, 1837 Board of Regents meeting where Henry Schoolcraft presented a resolution calling for a "Committee on the Library, Philosophical Apparatus, and Cabinet of Natural History" which led to the appointment of Dr. Asa Gray as the first University of Michigan Professor of Botany and Zoology (Bartlett, 13). In 1838, the Herbarium's original collections were started due to state geologist Douglass Houghton's first geological survey of Michigan. In 1839, Dr. Houghton was appointed as Professor of Geology and Mineralogy, and the collected specimens were placed under his supervision. During the 1840s, the collections were moved into Mason Hall and the University continued to receive donated specimens, including from Dr. Houghton and from Abram Sager (Mains, 1442-1443).</p><p> In 1855, the collections were gathered into the developing natural history museum under the direction of Alexander Winchell. At this time, the botanical specimens were under the same purview as geological and zoological specimens. Through the 1860s and 1870s, the Herbarium continued to receive donations, including from botanists Dr. George L. Ames, Josiah T. Scovell, Mary O. Rust, and Marcus Baker. These collections were placed under the now established Museum of Zoology. To manage the collections, Mark Walrod Harrington was appointed as an assistant and cataloged the collections. In addition, Louisa M. Reed and Elizabeth C. Allmendinger provided voluntary support to develop the herbarium and catalog the collections. Ms. Allmendinger engaged in plant switching with other institutions and published a list of plants within the Ann Arbor area, donating her personal collection to the herbarium (Ibid., 1443-1446). Throughout this time, professors in the Department of Botany were active in development of the collections. This established a norm where botany professors concurrently acted as curators of herbarium collections.</p><p> In 1876, Assistant Professor Joseph Beal Steere and Volney M. Spalding were placed in charge of the herbarium's collections. In 1879, Steere was given the official title of Curator for the museum. An 1881 reorganization of the museum by the Board of Regents split the management of the geology, zoology, and botany collections, stipulating that the professor in charge of instruction for a given topic should be the curator of its museum collection. As the Professor of Botany, Volney M. Spalding thus became curator. In the same year, the collection moved into the newly constructed museums building, with a new herbarium workspace established in 1893. During this time, although the Museum of Zoology had the official herbarium collections, the Department of Botany maintained a separate herbarium collection (Ibid., 1446-1447; Bartlett, 9).</p><p> The early 20th century saw significant changes for the botanical collections and the ultimate formation of the U-M Herbarium. In 1904, Spalding resigned, and Frederick Charles Newcombe was appointed Professor of Botany while Charles A. Davis was appointed curator of the collection. In addition, in 1905, the state legislature passed a bill establishing a new biological survey of Michigan under state geologist Alexander G. Ruthven. Due to the increasing collections, and increased interest in the collections, in 1908 staff numbers increased and in 1912, the curation of the collection was split into Curator of Cryptogamic Herbarium (Calvin H. Kauffman) and Curator of Phanerogamic Herbarium (Henry A. Gleason). A disastrous fire in 1913 destroyed a significant portion of the collections and a new museums building was not completed until 1915. To grow the collection, many new donations were received, including from Charles Keene Dodge, of the Michigan Biological Survey. Dodge's collection of 35,000 specimens was curated separately under Cecil Billington.</p><p> The herbarium as it stands today was established in 1921 under Director Calvin H. Kauffman. In 1921, the botanical collections, the herbaria of the Department of Botany, the herbarium in the Museum of Zoology, and Dodge's collections were united into the Herbarium of the University of Michigan and given a separate budget. Kauffman and John H. Ehlers were appointed curators, with Cecil Billington as an Honorary Curator. In 1926, Dr. Bessie B. Kanouse was appointed Curator and Assistant to the Director. By 1929, the Herbarium contained nearly 185,000 specimens in classified collections, and 75,000 undistributed specimens. This same year, the Herbarium purchased the collections of Professor Bruce Fink, adding over 16,700 specimens to the collection and bringing Joyce Hedrick Jones to the University as a research assistant (Mains, 1447-1449).</p><p> In 1930, an agreement between the Carnegie Institution and the University of Michigan led to biological surveys of Central America, including British Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico, until the cooperation ended in 1939. Several U-M faculty members and staff participated in expeditions, including the Botanical Gardens Director Harley H. Bartlett, Joseph B. Steere, and Cyrus Lundell. These studies grew the Herbarium collections considerably and led to many publications about botanical research in Central America. The Second World War interrupted the activities of the herbarium. Several herbarium staff took leaves of absence to assist with the war effort, including explorations in South America for the Board of Economic Warfare, and Professor Bartlett's work with the armed forces advocating botanical collection by armed forces abroad (Ibid., 1450-1451). Following the war, the botanical collections grew significantly with continued botanical expeditions and due to donations by botanists such as A.H. Poval, Paul M. Rea, E. B. Copeland, and Harley H. Bartlett (Ibid., 1454; Rogers &amp; Shaffer, 3-4). The acquisition of Harley H. Bartlett's specimens changed the Herbarium's collections from a predominantly locally-focused institution into a large, international research collection. (Rogers &amp; Shaffer, 4) After 1975, the collecting policies of the Herbarium shifted towards diversifying the collections through targeted gifts and exchanges rather than through field work, however field work has continued in North America and Mexico. In 1956, the Herbarium was absorbed into the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, remaining as a separate unit until July 1, 2011 when it became part of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (Reznicek).</p><p> The Herbarium's later research projects began with Professor Edward Voss' Michigan Flora Project, which started in 1956 and lasted for more than 40 years. The Michigan Flora Project led to the publication of the three volume <title render="italic">Michigan Flora</title> series and the Herbarium's current <title render="italic">Michigan Flora</title> database. In addition to the Michigan Flora Project, the U-M Herbarium contributed to several projects, including the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Flora Novo Galiciana, Flora of North America, Mosses of Mexico, Mosses of the Great Lakes Forests, Flora of China, and Flora of the Venezuelan Guyana. In 1974, the Herbarium was designated by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists as one of the 25 National Resource Center Collections in the United States and was ranked as one of the top three herbaria in the country. The U-M Herbarium is also a leader in digitizing herbaria collections, beginning with a 1977 database of seed plant types (Reznicek). The U-M Herbarium currently houses one of the best botanical collections in the world, housing over 1.7 million specimens, including renowned collections of vascular plants, algae, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens.</p>  <chronlist>

  <scopecontent><p>The collection represents the Herbarium's actions as a collector of the historical correspondence and photographs of botanical researchers. The records contained within this collection primarily document the research methods and professional conversations of American botanists. Through the correspondence and papers of Michigan and U-M botanists, this collection also documents the development of the Herbarium, its activities, and its status as a collector of botanical specimens and historical records. Researchers should note that there are photographs and plant specimens scattered throughout the correspondence series, and whereas the plant specimens are noted in the box listing, the photographs are not. The collection's four series include Harley Harris Bartlett Papers, Herbarium Historical Correspondence, Herbarium Historical Photographs, and Archived Website.</p></scopecontent>

H. Bartlett, who served as the Director of the Botanical Gardens from 1922 to 1955 and as chairman of the University of Michigan Department of Botany from 1922 to 1947. This series contains seven subseries: Index, Bureau of Plant Industry Correspondence, Correspondence and Associated Materials, Family Correspondence, Personal Correspondence, Photographs, and Special Interest. The Correspondence and Associated Materials, Photographs, and Special Interest subseries were collected and curated by the Herbarium and are arranged to conserve the Herbarium's order as established in the index. Researchers should note that the Bentley Historical Library also has a separate collection of Bartlett's papers received from the Bartlett Estate (call no. Aa/2; 85701). Due to the distinct provenance of the two collections, and the Herbarium's curation of this Bartlett series, the two collections are maintained separately.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_de036ff78a78bb846672aa10ed561993" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Index</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container label="Box" type="box">1</container></did><scopecontent><p>The Index subseries, undated (0.1 linear feet) consists of the U-M Herbarium's original catalog for the Correspondence and Associated Materials, Photographs, and Special Interest subseries.

The correspondence includes Bartlett's activities as a professor, the director of the Botanical Gardens, management of the Herbarium, and his relations with collectors, researchers, and botanical libraries. The subseries also contains Bartlett's bibliography and research journals related to Bartlett's international expeditions in Sumatra, the Philippines, Argentina, and Formosa.

These collections include photographic prints, negatives, and film. This subseries is of particular interest to researchers because it documents Bartlett's early ethno botanical research, portraying indigenous societies, archaeology, farming practices, and U-M research practices. The photographs and negatives include substantial metadata, both written on assorted prints and negatives and included in accompanying notebooks or envelopes, directly linking photographs to Bartlett's field notebooks, language materials, and collected specimens. Researchers should note the extensive Sumatra and the Far East collection, which captures Bartlett's multiple trips to the region and research into the Batak peoples of

This series includes Bartlett's research notes, field notes, and Indonesian language materials. This series also contains manuscript histories of botany at the University of Michigan and of the U-M botanical gardens. Also included are materials related to early botany, including a 1550 Cedar of Lebanon census and copies of correspondence by Alexander Garden, Asa Gray, and Edward Lee Greene.

a collection of historical botany-related correspondence as curated by the Herbarium. The Herbarium's original arrangement has been retained. The series includes correspondence by Herbarium faculty, Michigan botanists, and other notable American botanists. This series includes correspondence by University of Michigan School of Forestry director Charles A. Davis and University of Michigan Herbarium directors Calvin H. Kauffman and Edwin B. Mains. The series also includes correspondence by Herbarium founder Elizabeth Allmendinger, botany professor John Henry Ehlers, and curators Joyce Hedrick Jones, Bessie B. Kanouse, and Rogers McVaugh. Michigan botanists whose correspondence were collected by the Herbarium include Cecil Billington, Ernst A. Bessey (Professor of Mycology and Dean at Michigan State University), Emma J. Cole, Charles Keene Dodge (of the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey), and Clarence R. Hanes. In addition to Michigan botanists, the Herbarium collected papers of other leading botanical researchers. Represented names include Bruce Fink, leading lichenologist and chairman of the Miami University Department of Botany, Charles McIlvaine, Civil War veteran and leading mycologist, Charles H. Peck, the state botanist of New York, and Edward Tuckerman, a founding member of the Natural Historical Society of Boston. Other American botanists with records related to them include William Herbst, Howard A. Kelly, Charles E. Plitt, Paul Marshall Rea, and Edward B. Sterling.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_388e47730478821b3a1f824a703ec207" level="file"><did><unittitle>Allmendinger, Elizabeth</unittitle><unitdate normal="1866/1882"
