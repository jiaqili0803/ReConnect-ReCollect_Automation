        </p>
        <p>University records are public records and once fully processed are generally open to research use. Records that contain personally identifiable information will be restricted in order to protect individual privacy. Certain administrative records are restricted in accordance with university policy as outlined below. The restriction of university records is subject to compliance with applicable laws, including the Michigan Freedom of Information Act.</p>
        <p>Categories of Restricted Records        <list type="simple">
          <item><emph render="bold">Personnel-related files</emph>, including search, review, promotion, and tenure files, are restricted for thirty (30) years from the date of their creation.</item>
          <item><emph render="bold">Student educational records</emph>: FERPA's protection of personally identifiable information in a student's education records ends at the time of a student's death and therefore is a matter of institutional policy.  As a courtesy to the families of recently deceased students who were enrolled at the time of death, the University generally will not release information from their education records for five years without the consent of the deceased student's next of kin. Eighty-five (85) years after the date the records were first created, the University will presume that the student is deceased. Thereafter the student's education records will be open.  Student records at the Bentley Historical Library are restricted for eighty-five (85) years, but may also be made available upon proof of the death of the student.</item>
          <item><emph render="bold">Executive records</emph>: Records generated by the university's executive officers, deans, directors, department heads, and their designated support staff are restricted for twenty (20) years from the date of their creation.</item>

  <bioghist><p>The University Library system provides information resources and services to faculty, students, staff, and the public, and is comprised of undergraduate, graduate, and subject-oriented divisional collections. The library holds over seven million volumes and a wide variety of cartographic, audiovisual, manuscript, microform, and digital materials.</p><p><emph render="italic">(Please note that some of the libraries at the University of Michigan are not part of the University Library system. These include the Law Library, the Kresge Business Administration Library, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, the Clements Library, and the Bentley Historical Library. Individual findings aids for the record groups of most of these libraries can be found at the Bentley Library.)</emph></p><p>The Library has long played a central role in the development of the University. The Act of 1837, which provided for the organization of the university, included a provision stating that a portion of student fees would go toward increasing the library. The Board of Regents elected Reverend Henry Colclazer to serve as librarian. A year later, in September 1838, the Regents passed a resolution authorizing Asa Gray, Professor of Botany and Zoology, to purchase the materials to serve as the basis for the library's collection while on a tour of Europe, and appropriated $5000 for this purpose. While in London, Gray commissioned George Palmer Putnam to select most of the materials, developing a collection of 3,401 volumes covering the subjects of history, philosophy, literature, science, the arts, and law. The complete list of titles was printed as a state document in 1841. The Library is unusual in that, unlike most academic libraries, it was established through a major purchase rather than a gift.</p><p> In November 1841, the Regents approved the Regulations for the Library which included that the library would be open once a week, no books be loaned to students without faculty approval, that fines were to be paid for overdue books, and that no more than two volumes could be borrowed at a time. Initially housed in the home of one of the university's professors, the books were moved to the third floor of the Main Building in December 1841.</p><p>In 1854, President Henry Tappan initiated a subscription drive among Ann Arbor residents to raise funds for acquisitions and called for an annual appropriation from the Regents. These acts brought a steady infusion of money to ensure ongoing collection development. After years of having a succession of faculty members serve annual terms as the librarian, Tappan's son, John L. Tappan, was appointed as full-time librarian in 1856, and effectively became the first Librarian of the University.</p><p>As the Library's collections grew, it outgrew the space afforded it. After a series of shared homes, including spaces in the North University Building and the Law Building, the state legislature appropriated $100,000 for the library to have its own purpose-built building (1881). Opened in 1883 and located in the center of campus, the library consisted of a large reading room attached to cruciform stacks. When the library outgrew that space and several additions, the university secured over $350,000 from the legislature for a new building to be designed by Albert Kahn (1915). The existing library was demolished, and a new General Library building opened in 1920. Several divisional libraries, including collections devoted to rare books, natural science, chemical engineering, education, and museums were also established during this time period. Some of these collections were housed within the General Library while others were hosted out of academic departments or other buildings on campus.</p><p>Over the years the directors of the University Library made a number of important contributions to the development of the library and the larger field of library and information science. Andrew Ten Brook (1864 - 1877) introduced the library's first card catalog, with handwritten author and subject cards for both books and periodical articles. Raymond C. Davis (1877 - 1905) directed increased collection development and oversaw the opening of the first General Library building. Theodore W. Koch (1905 -1915) developed the library's first reference collection and instituted a library orientation program. William Warner Bishop (1915 - 1941), nationally recognized as one of the country's leading librarians, presided over the establishment of the Library Extension Service, the opening of the new General Library in 1920, the development of substantial divisional and specialized collections, and a number of cataloging innovations, in addition to leading the university's first Department of Library Science and serving terms as the presidents of the American Library Association (ALA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA).</p><p> In the 1950s and 1960s, the way in which the library provided services to the academic community evolved. Whereas once the General Library had served as the major research center for all academic subjects on campus, as the university's academic programs expanded and the need for collections to support those programs grew, the General Library's role came to be seen more as providing support solely for the humanities and social sciences. Specialized divisional libraries and libraries that provided services targeted to particular groups of patrons began to grow to support all other subjects. Rather than conceiving of them as small collections that supplemented the General Library, the library began developing larger and more self-contained divisional libraries, including the Physics-Astronomy Library, the first divisional library to be purpose-built rather than housed in a building designed for other purposes. As the network of campus libraries grew larger, the entire system came to be known as the University Library system.</p><p>The most important new library built in this time period was the Undergraduate Library, which opened in 1958. Designed to house a select collection of standard works commonly consulted by undergraduate students, the Undergraduate Library was the first large open-stack library on campus, though many of the divisional libraries already had open stacks. The Undergraduate Library differed from other libraries on campus in that it contained space for students to read, listen to recordings, and meet with others, as well as reference services specifically geared to undergraduate students. Open stacks were subsequently introduced in the General Library. These innovations led to increased library use and circulation on campus.</p><p> A seven-level addition to the General Library was constructed in 1970. The new addition nearly doubled the General Library's capacity, and provided added space for users and staff. While originally only the South Building was to be given a new name, soon after its opening the entire complex housing the North and South Buildings came to be called the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. New divisional libraries were also constructed in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably the Taubman Medical Library in 1979.</p><p>In the 1970s, the University Library system began a program of automated cataloging through the Michigan Library Consortium. Automation became fully integrated into library operations in August 1988, when the library's online catalog MIRLYN (Michigan Research Library Network) was introduced. The retrospective conversion of card catalog data was funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and included over 10 million bibliographic records, covering 99% of the library's collections.</p><p> The University Library continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most significant developments during the decade was the establishment of the library's Digital Library Services in 1993, which develops and maintains digital resources to support research and instruction and provides technology management services for the University Library system. Another important accomplishment was the library's participation in the campus-wide initiative led by President James Duderstadt to design the Media Union on North Campus. Opened in 1996, the Media Union houses the Art and Architecture and Engineering Libraries, and hosts and provides services for an extensive array of innovative digital tools and resources. Under the leadership of Paul Courant (University Librarian from 2007-2013), the University Library expanded its digital collections through its participation in the Google digitization project (an ambitious initiative to digitize all the books in the library) and the creation of HathiTrust Shared Digital Repository.</p><p> The University Library continues to be one of the leading research libraries in the world, with innovative programs in digital library services, access, and reference, and nearly unparalleled depth and breadth of collections. </p>  <chronlist>

Records in this series span the tenures of Richard M. Dougherty, Robert M. Warner, Don E. Riggs, William A. Gosling, and Paul Courant. However, the majority of the records originate from William A. Gosling's term as Director and Dean of the University Library.

Each subseries represents a separate accession of materials but when taken together they create a continuous file from 1905 to 1999. These series primarily consist of intra-university correspondence and correspondence with library donors, with other libraries around the world, with state and national library organizations, and with vendors.</p><p> In each of the subseries, the alphabetical arrangement devised by the director's office has been retained, although there are inconsistencies in it. Researchers should note that government agencies and other organizations are arranged hierarchically (e.g. "U.S. Library of Congress" and "Michigan. University. Library-Staff"), but this rule is not always applied, and material related to the two examples given can also be found directly under "Library of Congress" and "Staff", respectively. Organizations which have changed their names are usually found under all successive names. Material concerning the University of Michigan Library can be found under "General Library," "Michigan. University. General Library," and "Michigan. University. Library."</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_539d604939f1ea34e0a2ae04edac0796" level="subseries"><did><unitdate normal="1905/1950" type="inclusive">1905-1950</unitdate></did><scopecontent><p>The 1905-1959 subseries contains the office files of library directors Koch, Bishop, and Rice.

files of library directors Rice and Wagman. The materials concerning Frederick Wagman's work with the National Union Catalog (boxes 52 and 75) and the National Library of Medicine (boxes 114-115, 142) are particularly interesting. Wagman's daily diaries for 1953 to 1957 are found in box 126. These diaries served both as appointment books and notebooks in which Wagman recorded brief analyses of the meetings he attended.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_c6f36515cc176eec7037e942c9eb139a"

1965-1978. The materials found in 1965-1978 subseries represent a continuation of the 1957-1967 subseries, with some overlap in dates and with the same alphabetical arrangement and folder headings. The two subseries are, in fact, one working unit, distinct only in that they were accessioned into the university archives at different times. These materials comprise both office files and materials relating to Wagman's other professional activities. Noteworthy are the materials concerning Wagman's work with the National Advisory Commission on Libraries (112-113), and the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography (boxes 85-89). Wagman's daily diaries for the period 1967 to 1977 are found in box 160.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_fef9e9843108fcaf2ccb526d4b661e2d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Airlie House

A number of accessions were merged into one run of topical files. During Dougherty's tenure as director, the library's administrative structure was streamlined and several major automated systems such as MIRLYN (MIchigan Research LibrarY Network) and RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network), were installed to handle key operations in the areas of acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation. Dougherty's files provide strong documentation on various aspects of these transformations in the library during the 1980s.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_0d985221917467756796282c62e4edce"

Wagman, Richard M. Dougherty, and Robert M. Warner. All of these files are in an alphabetical topical arrangement. Of particular note in the Wagman files are library organizational charts spanning 1962-1977 and seven folders of Staff Circulars. These circulars provide documentation into library policies and procedures and the changes that evolved in them over the tenure of Wagman's directorship.</p><p> The files of Richard M. Dougherty encompass the largest portion of this series. The content of the files is varied, covering a wide range of library topics and issues. Perhaps the greatest interest can be found in the six Serials Differential Pricing folders. These illustrate the approach the University Library took with regard to rising serials prices.

The date ranges span the tenures of four directors (Richard Dougherty, Robert Warner, Donald Riggs, and the beginning of William Gosling's tenure). The bulk of the records are from the directorships of Warner and Riggs. Arranged in a single alphabetical run, the records illuminate the management of one of the ten largest research libraries in the country, with 350 employees, several divisional libraries, and a budget of over $20 million in the mid-1990s.</p><p> Notable themes covered within these records include the implementation of the online catalog (MIRLYN), expanding digital content and access, rising journal subscription costs, construction of the Information Technology Instruction Center (later Media Union) on North Campus, and staff and campus-wide diversity initiatives. Documentation of several key committees is found under the heading, "Library Governance," including the Dean's Cabinet, Library Council, and Management Advisory Council. These forums helped to establish and review policies as well as the allocation of staff and financial resources. Development files showcase efforts to aggressively raise funds to support the work of the library. One of the key development initiatives culminated in the creation of an endowed curator position for Judaica collections. The records also reflect involvement with state groups such as the Michigan Library Consortium, as well as national organizations such as the Research Library Group (RLG).</p></scopecontent><c04

While the subseries includes material dating back to 1981, the majority of the files date from 1996 to 1998. The records include central files from the tenures of several library directors/deans, including Richard Dougherty, Robert Warner, Donald Riggs, and William Gosling, with the bulk of the material from Gosling's interim director and director terms. Of particular note are the files on the Digital Library program (including the licensing of electronic resources), development initiatives and the Media Union.</p></scopecontent><c04

sub-series according to date: 1980-1998 (bulk 1989-1998); 1998/99; 1999/00; 2000/01; 2001/02; 2002-2005; and 2003-2013. Within each date range the files are organized alphabetically. A notable theme in the Topical Files sub-series is the University Library's efforts to provide new and improved library services through the creation and implementation of new technologies and information systems. Efforts like the Digital Library Initiative (DLI), and related projects, are well-documented. The records provide information on projects within the University of Michigan Library, as well as projects involving other institutions. There is also an abundance of material demonstrating the University Library's involvement with various organizations including the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), the Research Libraries Group (RLG), and the Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL), among several others.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_a5cea439f20f9dcc0371cc4770dfbd6a" level="subseries"><did><unitdate

The unusual character of the transfer reflects upon the peculiar worth attached to many of the records. This small subseries contains miscellaneous records from the period 1837 to 1948. A run of faculty circulation records from the period 1864 to 1904 (boxes 70-71) offers a window onto the changing research interests of various faculty members as the university was developing into a major research institution. Also included in this series are the files of correspondence between University President Harry B. Hutchins and Library Director Theodore Wesley Koch from 1910 to 1920 which document decisions made about the library's budget, acquisitions, and administrative policies (box 69).</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_76c43b8bb6f6610ae74f591c65293e4a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Papers concerning the shipment of documents to Ann Arbor</unittitle><unitdate normal="1837/1837" type="inclusive">1837</unitdate><container label="Box" type="box">69</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_81e222a27fb061d42a6378e5aa12f57f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Papers concerning payment of Asa Gray for the purchase of books in Europe</unittitle><unitdate normal="1839/1839" type="inclusive">1839</unitdate><container label="Box" type="box">69</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_0489c5b8d5fa36b46c27f4a4219efa54" level="file"><did><unittitle>List of books purchased for the library by Henry Philip Tappan</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container label="Box" type="box">69</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_f10546c2c3088c0c5b5c01d2fb72cbc2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Miscellaneous correspondence and reports</unittitle><unitdate normal="1870/1881" type="inclusive">1870-1881</unitdate><container label="Box" type="box">69</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_bd1fc849e589aa0f6e8e585a918e3af4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Papers concerning removal of Andrew Ten Brook as librarian and the appointment of Raymond C.

primarily concerned with internal library policy and management issues. Her appointment in this position allowed library director Dougherty to concentrate on the growing external library issues. Consequently the files in this series focus on a wide array of internal and local concerns. Many of the memos and reports in these files have been annotated by Stoffle. This series is arranged in alphabetical topical files largely retaining the arrangement of the files devised by the Deputy Director's office.</p></scopecontent><c02

2000/01; 2001/02; and 2002-2005. Within each date range the files are organized alphabetically. A notable theme in the Topical Files sub-series is the University Library's efforts to provide new and improved library services through the creation and implementation of new technologies and information systems. Efforts like the Digital Library Initiative (DLI), and related projects, are well-documented. The records provide information on projects within the University of Michigan Library, as well as projects involving other institutions. There is also an abundance of material demonstrating the University Library's involvement with various organizations including the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), the Research Libraries Group (RLG), and the Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL), among several others.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_788e14f164ba19f27cf74373e893e289" level="otherlevel"

The bulk of the records are from 1984 to 1990. Both Stoffle and Crist eventually left the library to serve as library directors at major research universities. The files reflect the close working arrangement between the library director and the associate director. These records provide a higher level of detail than what is found within similarly named files in the Director's Office series. The files richly illustrate the various branch and divisional libraries along with efforts to provide greater service and enhanced bibliographic instruction. The Subgroup consists of a Topical File divided in to two chronological subseries: 1976-1993 and 1988-1998</p><p> The 1988-1998 subseries (0.25 linear feet) of the Assistant Director for Public Services Files, is comprised of a small set of files from the Margo Crist's tenure as AD for Public Services. Of particular note are the folders related to the work of the University Library Strategic Planning Committee in the early 1990s.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_1e9f2f6ea3045a58eb507d5614dc3327"

includes introductory materials related to the committee, photographs of the October 1998 Diversity Celebration, and Diversity Committee meeting minutes. Also included are several General folders, dated 1988-2004, that contain additional information on the committee's activities, and provide supplemental information to the meeting minutes. The University of Michigan Library Diversity Committee had its roots as the Diversity Task Force, which was formed in 1985. In 1989 the ad hoc Diversity Task Force became more formalized and a permanent Library Diversity Committee was formed. The Diversity Committee's mission includes advising library administration, acting as a resource for library staff, and implementing activities promoting diversity within the library (Library Diversity Committee web site).</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_caddfa3510396ba34088c4a9d96b39ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle></did><c04

Library Information Technology (LIT) series, 1985-2002 (bulk 1993-2002) is organized alphabetically, and contains an abundance of material on the University Library's efforts to increase and improve the use of technology as a library tool. LIT is a program focused on the development and maintenance of digital resources and the provision of technology management services and support for the University Library system (LIT website). This series is a nice complement to the DIRECTOR'S OFFICE FILES series, providing additional materials on many of the digital initiatives underway in the library at that time. As with the Director's Office Files, there is a wealth of material on the Digital Library Initiative (DLI). Other notable topics include the Pricing Electronic Access to Knowledge (PEAK) field experiment, which was conducted to investigate new pricing and product plans for electronic journals (PEAK web site), and the creation of Making of America (MOA), a digital library of primary sources in America social History from the antebellum period through reconstruction (MOA home page). There are also several files containing information on the library's involvement with JSTOR, and with a variety of projects through the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC).</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_70d1ff98d1bc41f8987f885cfcb1228d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Academic Image Cooperative</unittitle><unitdate normal="1998/2000"

alphabetically and contains files related to the career and activities of librarian Jean Loup. Loup held several different offices and roles during her time with the University Library including assistant to the library dean, head of the Department of Communications, Public Relations, and Grant Writing, chair of the Academic Affairs Advisory Committee (AAAC), library delegate to the Senate Assembly, vice-chair and chair of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA), and leader in many projects including M-Quality (Regent's Proceedings). Topics that are particularly well-documented in this series include the AAAC (especially during Loup's tenure as chair), and M-Quality, a campus-wide initiative designed to encourage continuous
