       "      <td>The origins of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL) can be traced to two related projects initiated in the 1930s at the University of Michigan. In early 1934, Professor Lewis G. Vander Velde successfully applied for a $700 grant to locate and collect primary source material relating to the history of Michigan. Approximately a year later, in November 1935, University of Michigan President Alexander Ruthven appointed a Committee on University Archives and authorized it to gather together the university's historical records. Vander Velde served as secretary to this committee. Space was set aside in the William L. Clements Library for both projects, and Vander Velde, with the assistance of a single graduate student, undertook both projects. In June 1938, the two enterprises moved into three rooms of the newly completed Rackham Building. That same year the Regents named the endeavor the Michigan Historical Collections (MHC). In 1973, the library moved from its quarters in the Rackham Building into the newly completed Bentley Historical Library on the university's north campus. For the first time, the MHC had for a home a facility designed and built for the processing and use of the manuscript and archival materials that it had been collecting for nearly forty years.,  In the formative years of the MHC, Vander Velde supervised a surprisingly large staff. Funds from the Works Progress Administration made possible the hiring of a large number of special assistants. In 1939, twenty individuals were packing, processing, and cleaning records as they were collected. Although World War II quickly drained away the funds used to pay these many employees, a great deal of work was accomplished and Vander Velde retained some professional assistance. In 1938 or 1939, Vander Velde hired a full-time assistant primarily to collect historical records. In 1951, he added a permanent printed works librarian to the staff.,  In 1947, Vander Velde was appointed chair of the university's history department. To lighten his administrative burden at the MHC, F. Clever Bald was appointed to the newly created post, assistant director. Vander Velde retained the title of director of the MHC until 1960, when he retired and was succeeded by Bald. In 1966 Bald retired and was succeeded by Robert M. Warner. In 1980, Warner resigned as director to become head of the National Archives. Richard Doolen served as acting director until 1981 when Francis X. Blouin, Jr. became the fourth director of the BHL. Blouin would serve as director until 2013.,  In 1979, a separate program for the administration of the university archives was formally established. The University Archives and Records Program (UARP) became a separate division alongside the MHC, which continued to focus on documenting the state of Michigan. Reference services and conservation were reconfigured as divisions providing the current structure of four divisions (MHC, UARP, Reference and Access, and Preservation and Conservation) under the broader designation of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL). A fifth division, Digital Curation was added to the BHL in April 2011 to handle the preservation and archiving of digital records.,  Issued in 2004 on the occasion of the dedication of an addition to its building The Bentley Historical Library Its History and Purpose provides a more complete history of the Bentley Historical Library.

       "0  The origins of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL) can be traced to two related projects initiated in the 1930s at the University of Michigan. In early 1934, Professor Lewis G. Vander Velde successfully applied for a $700 grant to locate and collect primary source material relating to the history of Michigan. Approximately a year later, in November 1935, University of Michigan President Alexander Ruthven appointed a Committee on University Archives and authorized it to gather together the university's historical records. Vander Velde served as secretary to this committee. Space was set aside in the William L. Clements Library for both projects, and Vander Velde, with the assistance of a single graduate student, undertook both projects. In June 1938, the two enterprises moved into three rooms of the newly completed Rackham Building. That same year the Regents named the endeavor the Michigan Historical Collections (MHC). In 1973, the library moved from its quarters in the Rackham Building into the newly completed Bentley Historical Library on the university's north campus. For the first time, the MHC had for a home a facility designed and built for the processing and use of the manuscript and archival materials that it had been collecting for nearly forty years.,  In the formative years of the MHC, Vander Velde supervised a surprisingly large staff. Funds from the Works Progress Administration made possible the hiring of a large number of special assistants. In 1939, twenty individuals were packing, processing, and cleaning records as they were collected. Although World War II quickly drained away the funds used to pay these many employees, a great deal of work was accomplished and Vander Velde retained some professional assistance. In 1938 or 1939, Vander Velde hired a full-time assistant primarily to collect historical records. In 1951, he added a permanent printed works librarian to the staff.,  In 1947, Vander Velde was appointed chair of the university's history department. To lighten his administrative burden at the MHC, F. Clever Bald was appointed to the newly created post, assistant director. Vander Velde retained the title of director of the MHC until 1960, when he retired and was succeeded by Bald. In 1966 Bald retired and was succeeded by Robert M. Warner. In 1980, Warner resigned as director to become head of the National Archives. Richard Doolen served as acting director until 1981 when Francis X. Blouin, Jr. became the fourth director of the BHL. Blouin would serve as director until 2013.,  In 1979, a separate program for the administration of the university archives was formally established. The University Archives and Records Program (UARP) became a separate division alongside the MHC, which continued to focus on documenting the state of Michigan. Reference services and conservation were reconfigured as divisions providing the current structure of four divisions (MHC, UARP, Reference and Access, and Preservation and Conservation) under the broader designation of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL). A fifth division, Digital Curation was added to the BHL in April 2011 to handle the preservation and archiving of digital records.,  Issued in 2004 on the occasion of the dedication of an addition to its building The Bentley Historical Library Its History and Purpose provides a more complete history of the Bentley Historical Library.

In 1959 the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A) had proposed the expansion of \"area studies\" at the University of Michigan. This proposal included the establishment of four \"area centers\": the Center for Chinese Studies, the Center for Russian and Eastern European Studies, the Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies as well as CSSEAS, using the Center for Japanese Studies as a model. Special emphasis was placed on the mastery of foreign languages and field research abroad. CSSEAS soon became a distinguished \"area center,\" an institution within the American university system supporting interdisciplinary study on a specific cultural and geographic region of the world.,  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s CSSEAS sponsored and hosted many conferences and summer programs, bringing together scholars, students and South and Southeast Asians from around the world. Associates are drawn from the faculty and students of existing University of Michigan departments and programs, especially history, political science, anthropology and linguistics to work together and share ideas about South and Southeast Asian topics. Many students do dual concentrations in South and Southeast Asian studies and other subjects, especially business and linguistics. In 1993 CSSEAS became part of the International Institute, which administers the university's area centers.,  In 1999, two new independent units emerged from the Center: the Center for South Asian Studies and the Center for Southeast Asian Studies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Theodore Huntington Hubbell papers form a disparate collection that documents not only his professional career as an entomologist and curator, but also sheds light on the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Hubbell and Hussey families. The far-reaching scope of these papers derives from Theodore H. and Grace Griffin Hubbell's diligent collecting of family papers and photographs. The bulk of the early materials are Hussey family papers consisting of the personal papers of Grace's mother, Lenora Hussey Griffin, and her mother's nuclear family. This family consisted of Lenora's parents, John Milton and Mary C. Hussey, and her siblings, William J., Edgar P., Arthur, and Alice, and their spouses.,  The Theodore H. Hubbell papers should be viewed as a subset of a larger universe of collections which include the Hussey family and Hubbell family collections here at the Bentley Historical Library and the John Milton Hussey letters and diary at the University of Michigan's William Clements Library. The strengths of this collection are diverse, ranging from a rich run of Civil War correspondence between John Milton and Mary C. Hussey, to Lenora Hussey Griffin's letters to her family about her education at Stanford, to Theodore Hubbell and J. Speed Rogers correspondence with various entomologists regarding field work and collecting. The collection will be of use to researchers interested in nineteenth-century agriculture, the Grange in Ohio, family life and customs, Joseph B. Steere's expedition to the Philippine Islands, and visual images of turn of the century Michigan and the University of Michigan. The collection is weak on documenting Theodore Hubbell's work as a teacher and curator of the Museum of Zoology; these records are retained by the museum for use in administering their collections.,  The Theodore H. Hubbell papers span the years 1833-1988, with the bulk of materials covering the years 1852-1970; they are organized into five series: Genealogy, Hussey Family, Hubbell Family, Personal, and Professional. The first three series reflect Theodore and Grace Griffin Hubbell's efforts as genealogist/archivist for their respective families. The Personal series primarily deals with the private lives of Theodore and Grace Hubbell, but it also contains some materials linked to the first three series in the correspondence with Lenora Hussey Griffin. The materials in the first four series were rearranged during the course of processing to facilitate access to the Hussey and Hubbell family papers. The last series consists of Theodore Hubbell's professional correspondence (including letters to his cousin Roland F. Hussey) and project related materials; this series retains its original order.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Theodore Huntington Hubbell was professor of entomology at the University of Michigan from 1946 to 1968 and director of its Museum of Zoology from 1956 until his retirement in 1968. Even after his ostensible retirement, Hubbell came to the museum daily and served as \"everybody's mentor\" until his death in 1989. Hubbell's professional reputation rested on his enduring interest in and extensive writings on Orthoptera, and his local reputation rested on the organizational skills he demonstrated in the administration of space and resources within the museum. Theodore was born in Detroit in 1897 to Clarence (Detroit's Civil Engineer) and Winifred Hubbell. The family spent the years 1907 to 1913 in the Philippine Islands where Clarence worked as civil engineer for Manila and where Theodore first developed his interests in natural history and entomology. The younger Hubbell earned two degrees from the University of Michigan: his B.A. in 1920 and his Ph.D. in 1934, working in the interim as a professor of entomology in Gainesville at the University of Florida.,  In one sense Hubbell never left Ann Arbor for, as he continued his doctoral research, he was building up the collection of Orthoptera in the Museum of Zoology. This continuing relationship was doubtless encouraged by Hubbell's mentor, Alexander Ruthven, and by the construction of a new museums building in which to house the burgeoning collections. While in Florida, Hubbell did not stray far from his Michigan roots intellectually as he joined a staff anchored by J. Speed Rogers, another student of Ruthven. Both men took to heart Ruthven's teaching that a systematic understanding of zoology, one that linked historical geography and habitats to the distribution and evolution of insects, was the most rational natural philosophy. This close relationship between environment and fauna was a hallmark of University of Michigan zoologists and may be seen as laying the groundwork for the ecological sciences. Both Rogers and Hubbell returned to the University of Michigan in 1946, Rogers as director of the Museum of Zoology, Hubbell as curator of insects at the museum and professor of entomology.,  Rogers' and Hubbell's impact on the museum was immediate and beneficial as they reorganized the extensive holdings of the insects to make them more accessible to the appropriate researchers. They each brought their own considerable area of expertise to play on the museum's holdings of craneflies and grasshoppers. With the unexpected death of Rogers in 1955, Hubbell assumed more obvious control of the administrative aspects of the museum. Under his direction, existing programs of teaching and research were broadened, ties with the zoology department were strengthened, systematic biology came to prominence in the curriculum, and a research wing was added to the museum with monies from the National Science Foundation. Hubbell was instrumental in the formation of the inter-university Organization for Tropical Studies, played a significant role in expanding the study of biological systematics in a number of contexts, and advised the National Science Foundation on facilities and programs most needful to zoological museums. In recognition of his accomplishments and service the University conferred a distinguished faculty achievement award upon Hubbell.,  Theodore Hubbell married Grace Griffin in Ann Arbor in June 1927. By so doing, Hubbell linked himself to a family with further ties to the University of Michigan. Grace's uncle, William J. Hussey, was professor of astronomy at the university in 1891-1892 and from 1915 until his death in 1926; William's wife, Ethel Fountain Hussey, was a distinguished alumna whose philanthropy is commemorated by an eponymous room in the Michigan League. Grace's cousin, Roland F. Hussey, taught Ornithology in 1918 and returned (at the behest of Theodore Hubbell) as visiting zoologist specializing in Hemiptera during the 1950s. Another cousin, Russell C. Hussey, was professor of geology during the 1920s and served as assistant to the dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts during the 1930s. Theodore and Grace had three children, Roger, Mary Joan, and Stephen.</td>\n",

The library holds over seven million volumes and a wide variety of cartographic, audiovisual, manuscript, microform, and digital materials., (Please note that some of the libraries at the University of Michigan are not part of the University Library system. These include the Law Library, the Kresge Business Administration Library, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, the Clements Library, and the Bentley Historical Library. Individual findings aids for the record groups of most of these libraries can be found at the Bentley Library.), The Library has long played a central role in the development of the University. The Act of 1837, which provided for the organization of the university, included a provision stating that a portion of student fees would go toward increasing the library. The Board of Regents elected Reverend Henry Colclazer to serve as librarian. A year later, in September 1838, the Regents passed a resolution authorizing Asa Gray, Professor of Botany and Zoology, to purchase the materials to serve as the basis for the library's collection while on a tour of Europe, and appropriated $5000 for this purpose. While in London, Gray commissioned George Palmer Putnam to select most of the materials, developing a collection of 3,401 volumes covering the subjects of history, philosophy, literature, science, the arts, and law. The complete list of titles was printed as a state document in 1841. The Library is unusual in that, unlike most academic libraries, it was established through a major purchase rather than a gift.,  In November 1841, the Regents approved the Regulations for the Library which included that the library would be open once a week, no books be loaned to students without faculty approval, that fines were to be paid for overdue books, and that no more than two volumes could be borrowed at a time. Initially housed in the home of one of the university's professors, the books were moved to the third floor of the Main Building in December 1841., In 1854, President Henry Tappan initiated a subscription drive among Ann Arbor residents to raise funds for acquisitions and called for an annual appropriation from the Regents. These acts brought a steady infusion of money to ensure ongoing collection development. After years of having a succession of faculty members serve annual terms as the librarian, Tappan's son, John L. Tappan, was appointed as full-time librarian in 1856, and effectively became the first Librarian of the University., As the Library's collections grew, it outgrew the space afforded it. After a series of shared homes, including spaces in the North University Building and the Law Building, the state legislature appropriated $100,000 for the library to have its own purpose-built building (1881). Opened in 1883 and located in the center of campus, the library consisted of a large reading room attached to cruciform stacks. When the library outgrew that space and several additions, the university secured over $350,000 from the legislature for a new building to be designed by Albert Kahn (1915). The existing library was demolished, and a new General Library building opened in 1920. Several divisional libraries, including collections devoted to rare books, natural science, chemical engineering, education, and museums were also established during this time period. Some of these collections were housed within the General Library while others were hosted out of academic departments or other buildings on campus., Over the years the directors of the University Library made a number of important contributions to the development of the library and the larger field of library and information science. Andrew Ten Brook (1864 - 1877) introduced the library's first card catalog, with handwritten author and subject cards for both books and periodical articles. Raymond C. Davis (1877 - 1905) directed increased collection development and oversaw the opening of the first General Library building. Theodore W. Koch (1905 -1915) developed the library's first reference collection and instituted a library orientation program. William Warner Bishop (1915 - 1941), nationally recognized as one of the country's leading librarians, presided over the establishment of the Library Extension Service, the opening of the new General Library in 1920, the development of substantial divisional and specialized collections, and a number of cataloging innovations, in addition to leading the university's first Department of Library Science and serving terms as the presidents of the American Library Association (ALA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA).,  In the 1950s and 1960s, the way in which the library provided services to the academic community evolved. Whereas once the General Library had served as the major research center for all academic subjects on campus, as the university's academic programs expanded and the need for collections to support those programs grew, the General Library's role came to be seen more as providing support solely for the humanities and social sciences. Specialized divisional libraries and libraries that provided services targeted to particular groups of patrons began to grow to support all other subjects. Rather than conceiving of them as small collections that supplemented the General Library, the library began developing larger and more self-contained divisional libraries, including the Physics-Astronomy Library, the first divisional library to be purpose-built rather than housed in a building designed for other purposes. As the network of campus libraries grew larger, the entire system came to be known as the University Library system., The most important new library built in this time period was the Undergraduate Library, which opened in 1958. Designed to house a select collection of standard works commonly consulted by undergraduate students, the Undergraduate Library was the first large open-stack library on campus, though many of the divisional libraries already had open stacks. The Undergraduate Library differed from other libraries on campus in that it contained space for students to read, listen to recordings, and meet with others, as well as reference services specifically geared to undergraduate students. Open stacks were subsequently introduced in the General Library. These innovations led to increased library use and circulation on campus.,  A seven-level addition to the General Library was constructed in 1970. The new addition nearly doubled the General Library's capacity, and provided added space for users and staff. While originally only the South Building was to be given a new name, soon after its opening the entire complex housing the North and South Buildings came to be called the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. New divisional libraries were also constructed in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably the Taubman Medical Library in 1979., In the 1970s, the University Library system began a program of automated cataloging through the Michigan Library Consortium. Automation became fully integrated into library operations in August 1988, when the library's online catalog MIRLYN (Michigan Research Library Network) was introduced. The retrospective conversion of card catalog data was funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and included over 10 million bibliographic records, covering 99% of the library's collections.,  The University Library continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most significant developments during the decade was the establishment of the library's Digital Library Services in 1993, which develops and maintains digital resources to support research and instruction and provides technology management services for the University Library system. Another important accomplishment was the library's participation in the campus-wide initiative led by President James Duderstadt to design the Media Union on North Campus. Opened in 1996, the Media Union houses the Art and Architecture and Engineering Libraries, and hosts and provides services for an extensive array of innovative digital tools and resources. Under the leadership of Paul Courant (University Librarian from 2007-2013), the University Library expanded its digital collections through its participation in the Google digitization project (an ambitious initiative to digitize all the books in the library) and the creation of HathiTrust Shared Digital Repository.,  The University Library continues to be one of the leading research libraries in the world, with innovative programs in digital library services, access, and reference, and nearly unparalleled depth and breadth of collections.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Jacob Ellsworth Reighard, professor of zoology at the University of Michigan, was born at LaPorte, Indiana, July 2, 1861, the son of John D. and Mary Hulburt Reighard. Reighard attended the public schools at LaPorte, Indiana, entered the Literary Department of the University of Michigan in the fall of 1878, and graduated with the Ph.D degree in 1882. Following his graduation he taught for three years in Indiana and Massachusetts. During the last two years of this period he was a private student of Dr. E.L. Mark of Harvard University. After this he spent a year at Michigan in the study of medicine.,  He began his teaching career at Michigan in 1886 when he was appointed Instructor in Zoology. During the absence of Professor Joseph B. Steere he served as Acting Assistant Professor, 1887-88, and was made Assistant Professor of Zoology in 1889. Jacob Reighard was directly responsible for many changes in the character of zoology courses. To the old group of courses dealing with the systematics and natural history of various animal groups, he added Vertebrate Dissections, Histology of Vertebrates, Elements of Biology (Animal Life), and Embryology, each of which required laboratory work as well as the usual lectures or recitations. Beginning in 1889 the zoological courses were listed in two groups in the catalogue, \"General Zoology\" Systematic taught by Professor Steere, and Animal Morphology given by Professor Reighard. In 1892 Professor Reighard was made Professor of Animal Morphology; his department was separated from the old department and was known as the Morphological Laboratory.,  Professor Reighard spent the year 1894-95 in study at the University of Freiburg, Germany. After his return in 1895 his title was changed to Professor of Zoology and Director of the Zoological Laboratory and the Museum of Zoology. The museum position he retained until 1913. He continued as Director of the Zoological Laboratory until 1925 when he relinquished the active directorship, retaining his professorship until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1927. In 1936, after the close of his active career, the University of Michigan conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Science.,  With Professor Frederick C. Newcombe and Dr. George P. Burns of the Department of Botany, Professor Reighard was a cofounder of the University of Michigan Biological Station on Douglas Lake in Cheboygan County in 1909 and was its first Director. Professor Reighard's contribution to the development of the research function of the Museum of Zoology during his directorship, 1895-1913, was stated thus by his successor: \"During this time the museum was made up of a number of collections under the direction of the heads of several teaching departments. It is largely due to Professor Reighard that the Museum of Zoology did not become an adjunct to a teaching department but was an independent research department of the University. Professor Reighard directed the scientific work of the Michigan Fish Commission for the years 1890-1895 during which time a number of important research projects were carried through to completion. Although for lack of support this series of investigations came to a close in 1895, the present Institute for Fisheries Research of the Michigan Department of Conservation probably should be considered to be \"the delayed outgrowth of the scientific work which he did for the Michigan Fish Commission\" some decades earlier.,  In 1898-1901, professor Reighard was in charge of the Biological Survey of the Great Lakes conducted by the U.S. Fish Commission, and for some years beginning in 1917 he directed important researches on the food fishes of the Great Lakes. As an outgrowth of the latter and possibly indirectly as the result of his own earlier work on the Great Lakes came the establishment in Ann Arbor of the Great Lakes Laboratory of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).,  Professor Reighard held membership and served as officer in various scientific organizations including A.A.A.S. (vice president of Section F, 1910), American Society of Naturalists, American Society of Zoologists (vice president of the eastern branch and president of the central branch in 1903), the Ecological Society of America, American Fisheries Society (president, 1915), and the Michigan Academy of Science (president, 1900). He presided at two sessions on Animal Behavior at the International Zoological Congress at Boston in 1907. For some years he served as trustee and member of the Executive Committee of the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, and was a member of the Board of Scientific Advisers of the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey.,  Professor Reighard was always interested in the improvement of methods and in the application of new methods to zoological research. An expert photographer, he described methods of photographing embryos, of photographing breeding fishes in their natural habitats, and of photographing coral-reef fishes by means of a submerged camera which he devised. His book on the \"Anatomy of the Cat\" written with H.S. Jennings has had extensive use in anatomical laboratories and was revised by Dr. Rush Elliott in the 1930's with the collaboration of Professor Reighard.,  In the later years of his active career, increasing deafness caused Reighard to learn speech reading. His interest in helping the deaf community led him to translate a number of German papers on this subject and to prepare several original papers, some of which are still in manuscript form. This work and the completion of manuscripts on breeding habits of fishes occupied much of his time after his retirement.,  Jacob Reighard was responsible for the development of modern zoological teaching and research at the University of Michigan. Through his teaching, his researches and his leadership in zoological organizations he exerted a marked influence upon zoology in the United States. Reighard died February 13, 1942 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

La Rue, Peter Okkelberg, and John F. Shepard.]</td>\n",

       "0    The Reeves papers largely concern JSR's activities as professor (also chairman) of the University of Michigan Department of Political Science from his appointment in 1910 until his retirement in 1937. The great bulk of the collection consists of Reeves' correspondence. With this is a smaller series of such other materials as lectures, research materials, professional organizational materials. As an aid to accessing the correspondence, a selective index of correspondents and subjects has been prepared and is appended to the following containing listing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "152  The Theodore Huntington Hubbell papers form a disparate collection that documents not only his professional career as an entomologist and curator, but also sheds light on the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Hubbell and Hussey families. The far-reaching scope of these papers derives from Theodore H. and Grace Griffin Hubbell's diligent collecting of family papers and photographs. The bulk of the early materials are Hussey family papers consisting of the personal papers of Grace's mother, Lenora Hussey Griffin, and her mother's nuclear family. This family consisted of Lenora's parents, John Milton and Mary C. Hussey, and her siblings, William J., Edgar P., Arthur, and Alice, and their spouses.,  The Theodore H. Hubbell papers should be viewed as a subset of a larger universe of collections which include the Hussey family and Hubbell family collections here at the Bentley Historical Library and the John Milton Hussey letters and diary at the University of Michigan's William Clements Library. The strengths of this collection are diverse, ranging from a rich run of Civil War correspondence between John Milton and Mary C. Hussey, to Lenora Hussey Griffin's letters to her family about her education at Stanford, to Theodore Hubbell and J. Speed Rogers correspondence with various entomologists regarding field work and collecting. The collection will be of use to researchers interested in nineteenth-century agriculture, the Grange in Ohio, family life and customs, Joseph B. Steere's expedition to the Philippine Islands, and visual images of turn of the century Michigan and the University of Michigan. The collection is weak on documenting Theodore Hubbell's work as a teacher and curator of the Museum of Zoology; these records are retained by the museum for use in administering their collections.,  The Theodore H. Hubbell papers span the years 1833-1988, with the bulk of materials covering the years 1852-1970; they are organized into five series: Genealogy, Hussey Family, Hubbell Family, Personal, and Professional. The first three series reflect Theodore and Grace Griffin Hubbell's efforts as genealogist/archivist for their respective families. The Personal series primarily deals with the private lives of Theodore and Grace Hubbell, but it also contains some materials linked to the first three series in the correspondence with Lenora Hussey Griffin. The materials in the first four series were rearranged during the course of processing to facilitate access to the Hussey and Hubbell family papers. The last series consists of Theodore Hubbell's professional correspondence (including letters to his cousin Roland F.

       "154  The Thomas Harrison Reed Collection is the papers of a man who was an active and important figure in the field of municipal government during much of the first half of this century. The Reed papers consist of eight feet of manuscript material, including correspondence, memos, newspaper clippings, and printed material. Over half of the collection deals primarily with Reed's work as a municipal consultant. The collection also contains a substantial amount of material which pertains to Reed's activities in connection with the American Political Science Association as well as material which relates to his academic career and correspondence with Michigan citizens and legislators and Michigan's Congressional representatives. In addition, the collection includes material on Belgium, Reed's work as city manager of San Jose, and his work with the Republican Program Committee.,  The Thomas Harrison Reed Collection provides useful material for research on the history of the activities of the National Municipal League and on trends and issues in municipal government during the first half of the twentieth century in the United States. The collection is also useful to anyone interested in the issues which were involved in the revision of city charters in many American cities during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. The collection contains, in particular, substantial material on reform in Atlanta during the 1930s.,  Although this collection contains material on Reed's association with The University of Michigan and some material which deals with government in Michigan, it would be of little use for research on any aspect of Michigan history. During his twelve-year residence in Michigan, Reed did little work which related specifically to municipal government in this state. He did publish Oakland County: a survey of county and township administration and finance in 1932, but the collection contains nothing of substance relating to this work. With this exception, and aside from some correspondence and a few speeches to such groups as the League of Women Voters, there is no material in this collection which would be of more than passing interest to one engaged in historical research relating to Michigan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The topic's priority is based on the Bentley Library's mission as established by the University of Michigan Board of Regents to document \"the state, its institutions, and its social, economic, and intellectual development,\" the historical collecting patterns of the library, and overall collection development priorities in all formats. The process of setting collecting priorities is described by Christine Weideman's \"A New Map for Field Work: Impact of Collections Analysis on the Bentley Historical Library\" (American Archivist, Winter 1991, Vol. 54 Issue 1, pp. 54-60.) and Judith E. Endelman's \"Looking Backward to Plan for the Future: Collection Analysis for Manuscript Repositories.\" (American Archivist, Summer 1987, Vol. 50 Issue 3, pp. 340-355.),  In selecting web content for permanent preservation, the Bentley Historical Library seeks:, As of 2013, the Bentley Library will concentrate efforts on documenting the transformation of Michigan's economy with a focus on the auto industry, emerging industries and the revitalization of Detroit. In addition to these priorities the MHC remains open to the consideration of material with great research potential in any area of Michigan's industrially diverse history.,  To learn more about the

       "4    The Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies (CSSEAS) was founded in 1961 with a grant from the Ford Foundation as part of a new American effort following World War II to study Asian languages, history and cultures. In 1959 the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&A) had proposed the expansion of \"area studies\" at the University of Michigan. This proposal included the establishment of four \"area centers\": the Center for Chinese Studies, the Center for Russian and Eastern European Studies, the Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies as well as CSSEAS, using the Center for Japanese Studies as a model. Special emphasis was placed on the mastery of foreign languages and field research abroad. CSSEAS soon became a distinguished \"area center,\" an institution within the American university system supporting interdisciplinary study on a specific cultural and geographic region of the world.,  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s CSSEAS sponsored and hosted many conferences and summer programs, bringing together scholars, students and South and Southeast Asians from around the world. Associates are drawn from the faculty and students of existing University of Michigan departments and programs, especially history, political science, anthropology and linguistics to work together and share ideas about South and Southeast Asian topics. Many students do dual concentrations in South and Southeast Asian studies and other subjects, especially business and linguistics. In 1993 CSSEAS became part of the International Institute, which administers the university's area centers.,  In 1999, two new independent units emerged from the Center: the Center for South Asian Studies and the Center for Southeast Asian Studies.

       "152  Theodore Huntington Hubbell was professor of entomology at the University of Michigan from 1946 to 1968 and director of its Museum of Zoology from 1956 until his retirement in 1968. Even after his ostensible retirement, Hubbell came to the museum daily and served as \"everybody's mentor\" until his death in 1989. Hubbell's professional reputation rested on his enduring interest in and extensive writings on Orthoptera, and his local reputation rested on the organizational skills he demonstrated in the administration of space and resources within the museum. Theodore was born in Detroit in 1897 to Clarence (Detroit's Civil Engineer) and Winifred Hubbell. The family spent the years 1907 to 1913 in the Philippine Islands where Clarence worked as civil engineer for Manila and where Theodore first developed his interests in natural history and entomology. The younger Hubbell earned two degrees from the University of Michigan: his B.A. in 1920 and his Ph.D. in 1934, working in the interim as a professor of entomology in Gainesville at the University of Florida.,  In one sense Hubbell never left Ann Arbor for, as he continued his doctoral research, he was building up the collection of Orthoptera in the Museum of Zoology. This continuing relationship was doubtless encouraged by Hubbell's mentor, Alexander Ruthven, and by the construction of a new museums building in which to house the burgeoning collections. While in Florida, Hubbell did not stray far from his Michigan roots intellectually as he joined a staff anchored by J. Speed Rogers, another student of Ruthven. Both men took to heart Ruthven's teaching that a systematic understanding of zoology, one that linked historical geography and habitats to the distribution and evolution of insects, was the most rational natural philosophy. This close relationship between environment and fauna was a hallmark of University of Michigan zoologists and may be seen as laying the groundwork for the ecological sciences. Both Rogers and Hubbell returned to the University of Michigan in 1946, Rogers as director of the Museum of Zoology, Hubbell as curator of insects at the museum and professor of entomology.,  Rogers' and Hubbell's impact on the museum was immediate and beneficial as they reorganized the extensive holdings of the insects to make them more accessible to the appropriate researchers. They each brought their own considerable area of expertise to play on the museum's holdings of craneflies and grasshoppers. With the unexpected death of Rogers in 1955, Hubbell assumed more obvious control of the administrative aspects of the museum. Under his direction, existing programs of teaching and research were broadened, ties with the zoology department were strengthened, systematic biology came to prominence in the curriculum, and a research wing was added to the museum with monies from the National Science Foundation. Hubbell was instrumental in the formation of the inter-university Organization for Tropical Studies, played a significant role in expanding the study of biological systematics in a number of contexts, and advised the National Science Foundation on facilities and programs most needful to zoological museums. In recognition of his accomplishments and service the University conferred a distinguished faculty achievement award upon Hubbell.,  Theodore Hubbell married Grace Griffin in Ann Arbor in June 1927. By so doing, Hubbell linked himself to a family with further ties to the University of Michigan. Grace's uncle, William J. Hussey, was professor of astronomy at the university in 1891-1892 and from 1915 until his death in 1926; William's wife, Ethel Fountain Hussey, was a distinguished alumna whose philanthropy is commemorated by an eponymous room in the Michigan League. Grace's cousin, Roland F. Hussey, taught Ornithology in 1918 and returned (at the behest of Theodore Hubbell) as visiting zoologist specializing in Hemiptera during the 1950s. Another cousin, Russell C. Hussey, was professor of geology during the 1920s and served as assistant to the dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts during the 1930s.

       "155  The University Library system provides information resources and services to faculty, students, staff, and the public, and is comprised of undergraduate, graduate, and subject-oriented divisional collections. The library holds over seven million volumes and a wide variety of cartographic, audiovisual, manuscript, microform, and digital materials., (Please note that some of the libraries at the University of Michigan are not part of the University Library system. These include the Law Library, the Kresge Business Administration Library, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, the Clements Library, and the Bentley Historical Library. Individual findings aids for the record groups of most of these libraries can be found at the Bentley Library.), The Library has long played a central role in the development of the University. The Act of 1837, which provided for the organization of the university, included a provision stating that a portion of student fees would go toward increasing the library. The Board of Regents elected Reverend Henry Colclazer to serve as librarian. A year later, in September 1838, the Regents passed a resolution authorizing Asa Gray, Professor of Botany and Zoology, to purchase the materials to serve as the basis for the library's collection while on a tour of Europe, and appropriated $5000 for this purpose. While in London, Gray commissioned George Palmer Putnam to select most of the materials, developing a collection of 3,401 volumes covering the subjects of history, philosophy, literature, science, the arts, and law. The complete list of titles was printed as a state document in 1841. The Library is unusual in that, unlike most academic libraries, it was established through a major purchase rather than a gift.,  In November 1841, the Regents approved the Regulations for the Library which included that the library would be open once a week, no books be loaned to students without faculty approval, that fines were to be paid for overdue books, and that no more than two volumes could be borrowed at a time. Initially housed in the home of one of the university's professors, the books were moved to the third floor of the Main Building in December 1841., In 1854, President Henry Tappan initiated a subscription drive among Ann Arbor residents to raise funds for acquisitions and called for an annual appropriation from the Regents. These acts brought a steady infusion of money to ensure ongoing collection development. After years of having a succession of faculty members serve annual terms as the librarian, Tappan's son, John L. Tappan, was appointed as full-time librarian in 1856, and effectively became the first Librarian of the University., As the Library's collections grew, it outgrew the space afforded it. After a series of shared homes, including spaces in the North University Building and the Law Building, the state legislature appropriated $100,000 for the library to have its own purpose-built building (1881). Opened in 1883 and located in the center of campus, the library consisted of a large reading room attached to cruciform stacks. When the library outgrew that space and several additions, the university secured over $350,000 from the legislature for a new building to be designed by Albert Kahn (1915). The existing library was demolished, and a new General Library building opened in 1920. Several divisional libraries, including collections devoted to rare books, natural science, chemical engineering, education, and museums were also established during this time period. Some of these collections were housed within the General Library while others were hosted out of academic departments or other buildings on campus., Over the years the directors of the University Library made a number of important contributions to the development of the library and the larger field of library and information science. Andrew Ten Brook (1864 - 1877) introduced the library's first card catalog, with handwritten author and subject cards for both books and periodical articles. Raymond C. Davis (1877 - 1905) directed increased collection development and oversaw the opening of the first General Library building. Theodore W. Koch (1905 -1915) developed the library's first reference collection and instituted a library orientation program. William Warner Bishop (1915 - 1941), nationally recognized as one of the country's leading librarians, presided over the establishment of the Library Extension Service, the opening of the new General Library in 1920, the development of substantial divisional and specialized collections, and a number of cataloging innovations, in addition to leading the university's first Department of Library Science and serving terms as the presidents of the American Library Association (ALA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA).,  In the 1950s and 1960s, the way in which the library provided services to the academic community evolved. Whereas once the General Library had served as the major research center for all academic subjects on campus, as the university's academic programs expanded and the need for collections to support those programs grew, the General Library's role came to be seen more as providing support solely for the humanities and social sciences. Specialized divisional libraries and libraries that provided services targeted to particular groups of patrons began to grow to support all other subjects. Rather than conceiving of them as small collections that supplemented the General Library, the library began developing larger and more self-contained divisional libraries, including the Physics-Astronomy Library, the first divisional library to be purpose-built rather than housed in a building designed for other purposes. As the network of campus libraries grew larger, the entire system came to be known as the University Library system., The most important new library built in this time period was the Undergraduate Library, which opened in 1958. Designed to house a select collection of standard works commonly consulted by undergraduate students, the Undergraduate Library was the first large open-stack library on campus, though many of the divisional libraries already had open stacks. The Undergraduate Library differed from other libraries on campus in that it contained space for students to read, listen to recordings, and meet with others, as well as reference services specifically geared to undergraduate students. Open stacks were subsequently introduced in the General Library. These innovations led to increased library use and circulation on campus.,  A seven-level addition to the General Library was constructed in 1970. The new addition nearly doubled the General Library's capacity, and provided added space for users and staff. While originally only the South Building was to be given a new name, soon after its opening the entire complex housing the North and South Buildings came to be called the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. New divisional libraries were also constructed in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably the Taubman Medical Library in 1979., In the 1970s, the University Library system began a program of automated cataloging through the Michigan Library Consortium. Automation became fully integrated into library operations in August 1988, when the library's online catalog MIRLYN (Michigan Research Library Network) was introduced. The retrospective conversion of card catalog data was funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and included over 10 million bibliographic records, covering 99% of the library's collections.,  The University Library continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most significant developments during the decade was the establishment of the library's Digital Library Services in 1993, which develops and maintains digital resources to support research and instruction and provides technology management services for the University Library system. Another important accomplishment was the library's participation in the campus-wide initiative led by President James Duderstadt to design the Media Union on North Campus. Opened in 1996, the Media Union houses the Art and Architecture and Engineering Libraries, and hosts and provides services for an extensive array of innovative digital tools and resources. Under the leadership of Paul Courant (University Librarian from 2007-2013), the University Library expanded its digital collections through its participation in the Google digitization project (an ambitious initiative to digitize all the books in the library) and the creation of HathiTrust Shared Digital Repository.,  The University Library continues to be one of the leading research libraries in the world, with innovative programs in digital library services, access, and reference, and nearly unparalleled depth and breadth of collections.    \n",
       "156  Jacob Ellsworth Reighard, professor of zoology at the University of Michigan, was born at LaPorte, Indiana, July 2, 1861, the son of John D. and Mary Hulburt Reighard. Reighard attended the public schools at LaPorte, Indiana, entered the Literary Department of the University of Michigan in the fall of 1878, and graduated with the Ph.D degree in 1882. Following his graduation he taught for three years in Indiana and Massachusetts. During the last two years of this period he was a private student of Dr. E.L. Mark of Harvard University. After this he spent a year at Michigan in the study of medicine.,  He began his teaching career at Michigan in 1886 when he was appointed Instructor in Zoology. During the absence of Professor Joseph B. Steere he served as Acting Assistant Professor, 1887-88, and was made Assistant Professor of Zoology in 1889. Jacob Reighard was directly responsible for many changes in the character of zoology courses. To the old group of courses dealing with the systematics and natural history of various animal groups, he added Vertebrate Dissections, Histology of Vertebrates, Elements of Biology (Animal Life), and Embryology, each of which required laboratory work as well as the usual lectures or recitations. Beginning in 1889 the zoological courses were listed in two groups in the catalogue, \"General Zoology\" Systematic taught by Professor Steere, and Animal Morphology given by Professor Reighard. In 1892 Professor Reighard was made Professor of Animal Morphology; his department was separated from the old department and was known as the Morphological Laboratory.,  Professor Reighard spent the year 1894-95 in study at the University of Freiburg, Germany. After his return in 1895 his title was changed to Professor of Zoology and Director of the Zoological Laboratory and the Museum of Zoology. The museum position he retained until 1913. He continued as Director of the Zoological Laboratory until 1925 when he relinquished the active directorship, retaining his professorship until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1927. In 1936, after the close of his active career, the University of Michigan conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Science.,  With Professor Frederick C. Newcombe and Dr. George P. Burns of the Department of Botany, Professor Reighard was a cofounder of the University of Michigan Biological Station on Douglas Lake in Cheboygan County in 1909 and was its first Director. Professor Reighard's contribution to the development of the research function of the Museum of Zoology during his directorship, 1895-1913, was stated thus by his successor: \"During this time the museum was made up of a number of collections under the direction of the heads of several teaching departments. It is largely due to Professor Reighard that the Museum of Zoology did not become an adjunct to a teaching department but was an independent research department of the University. Professor Reighard directed the scientific work of the Michigan Fish Commission for the years 1890-1895 during which time a number of important research projects were carried through to completion. Although for lack of support this series of investigations came to a close in 1895, the present Institute for Fisheries Research of the Michigan Department of Conservation probably should be considered to be \"the delayed outgrowth of the scientific work which he did for the Michigan Fish Commission\" some decades earlier.,  In 1898-1901, professor Reighard was in charge of the Biological Survey of the Great Lakes conducted by the U.S. Fish Commission, and for some years beginning in 1917 he directed important researches on the food fishes of the Great Lakes. As an outgrowth of the latter and possibly indirectly as the result of his own earlier work on the Great Lakes came the establishment in Ann Arbor of the Great Lakes Laboratory of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).,  Professor Reighard held membership and served as officer in various scientific organizations including A.A.A.S. (vice president of Section F, 1910), American Society of Naturalists, American Society of Zoologists (vice president of the eastern branch and president of the central branch in 1903), the Ecological Society of America, American Fisheries Society (president, 1915), and the Michigan Academy of Science (president, 1900). He presided at two sessions on Animal Behavior at the International Zoological Congress at Boston in 1907. For some years he served as trustee and member of the Executive Committee of the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, and was a member of the Board of Scientific Advisers of the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey.,  Professor Reighard was always interested in the improvement of methods and in the application of new methods to zoological research. An expert photographer, he described methods of photographing embryos, of photographing breeding fishes in their natural habitats, and of photographing coral-reef fishes by means of a submerged camera which he devised. His book on the \"Anatomy of the Cat\" written with H.S. Jennings has had extensive use in anatomical laboratories and was revised by Dr. Rush Elliott in the 1930's with the collaboration of Professor Reighard.,  In the later years of his active career, increasing deafness caused Reighard to learn speech reading. His interest in helping the deaf community led him to translate a number of German papers on this subject and to prepare several original papers, some of which are still in manuscript form. This work and the completion of manuscripts on breeding habits of fishes occupied much of his time after his retirement.,  Jacob Reighard was responsible for the development of modern zoological teaching and research at the University of Michigan. Through his teaching, his researches and his leadership in zoological organizations he exerted a marked influence upon zoology in the United States. Reighard died February 13, 1942 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

       "2   The Web Archive of Michigan's Ethnic and Cultural Communities collection contains archived websites created by various ethnic and cultural communities of the State of Michigan. The websites have been archived by the Bentley Historical Library, using the California Digital Library Web Archiving Service crawler from 2010-2015 and the Archive-It web archiving service beginning in 2015. Access to all websites archived by the Bentley Historical Library is available at: https://archive-it.org/organizations/934.,  Web Archives include websites of African American, Arab American, Native American, Asian American and other ethnic communities and organizations who call the state of Michigan home.

They had four children, including:  Albert W. (b. 1849) and Richard Edwin (\"R. E.\" or \"Eddy\") Alger (1854-1943).  Albert resided in Colony, Kansas, in the early 20th century, and Richard remained in Richfield for most or all of his life.  Richard married Esther D. Reynolds, a strongly spiritual woman, on October 4, 1888.  The couple's children included Emma, Mary, Esther Marion, Margaret (b. 1890), and David Bruce (b. December 8, 1891).  , David Bruce Alger attended Oberlin College in the early 1910s.  He graduated and had moved to Cleveland, Ohio, by 1916.  He married Clare Fleeman on October 13, 1916.  David Alger worked in the banking industry for much of his life and kept a series of short daily diaries from 1910 until 1973, which documented his time in Ohio, Texas, Missouri, and Florida.  Clare, an aspiring poet and writer, contributed to a variety of religious and literary publications throughout her life and was a member of the St. Louis Writers' Guild in the 1940s., David Bruce and Clare Fleeman Alger's son, Bruce Reynolds Alger, was born in Dallas, Texas, on June 12, 1918. The family moved to Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Bruce Alger shared his father's love for football, played for his high school football team, and, later, on Princeton University's squad.  Following his graduation from Princeton (1940) and a brief stint as a field representative for the RCA Victor Manufacturing Company, Bruce enlisted in the Army Air Corps after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  He was stationed with the Fifth Squadron at the Army Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kerry Field, Texas, and he spent much of the war in training throughout the United States.  Bruce did see action in the Pacific theater in 1945, and spent time in Japan soon after the Japanese surrender.  Bruce received his discharge in November 1945, settled in Dallas, and pursued a career in real estate.  He later represented Texas' 5th District in the United States House of Representatives (1955-1965).  He returned to his real estate business in Dallas after a failed reelection bid.</td>\n",

       "      <td>, At home, Jane's new job responsibilities brought her into contact with a supervisor and colleague whom she did not like. She tried to work out differences peacefully but still felt that she ended up doing more work than they, adding to the difficulty she felt in the need to balance her work and keeping house: \"Sometimes I wonder whether I'm doing a good job of housekeeping, and whether it will be the way you'd like to find it when you return. I know it's not a perfect job, but I excuse it by saying that you can't hold down two jobs and do them both perfectly.\" Jane felt obligated to spend time with both her own family and Johnson's. To help ease the situation, Jane's mother suggested she move home until the war ended \"to save money.\" However Jane wanted to maintain her independence and refused. , The effects of rationing were painfully evident during the holidays. \"Turkeys were very scarce this year. You could get them through black markets at about $1 a pound, and some few people were able to get them at a legitimate price...\" Cigarettes and sugar were scarce as well. Jane regretted that butter, milk, and eggs were considered part of the meat ration. Her neighbor down the hall often procured meat for her because she had a butcher who would sell her extra. The black market flourished. , While billeted in Stolberg, Germany, Johnson also complained of shortages: \"Certain war correspondents has said the shell shortage is not due so much to the lack of production as failure to foresee the tremendous need--whatever the cause we need stuff--now!\" He mentioned that work strikes by war plant workers made him furious because the soldiers suffered from the shortage of ammunitions. , On December 16, 1944, the Germans mustered their forces for a last major offensive in the Ardennes. On Christmas day, just five kilometers from the front, Johnson wrote his wife to tell her that he had saved her packages to open on Christmas, although in reality, he had already opened them fearing that he would not live until Christmas. Johnson survived the Battle of the Bulge, earning a Bronze Star in the process. , Johnson's company liberated Nordhausen, one of the concentration camps in Germany in early April 1945, near the end of the war. He was horrified by the sight: \"Nearly 500 foreign slave laborers were lying in filth nearly dead from starvation in town.\" What he saw in Germany piqued his hatred of the German civilians, and he complained of a \"feeling of disgust\" when seeing German civilians: \"They collect pictures of Hitler and the Luftwaffe. When they cry now that such and such is a hardship, I feel like telling them to write a letter to Hitler.\" , With the war in Europe ended in May, 1945, Johnson desperately longed to return home, but did not have enough points to do so. He remained in Germany through the summer and fall, billeted in Egelsbach, where he set up a beer hall for officers and enlisted men, and where they even served lunch. Due in part to his Bronze Star, Johnson was promoted to Master Sergeant before boarding the Montclair Victory Ship on October 19 1945, bound for the States. , Upon learning that the war was over, Johnson told his wife to quit her job immediately, reasoning that he would be able to stay at the job he had left working for a textile company. The couple wanted to start a family as soon as possible.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Grosvenor Lowery Townsend (1874-1956) was born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents Malcolm (1847-?) and Emma Virginia Townsend (1849-?).  First joining the ranks of the New York National Guard, 7th Regiment, Company D, on September 29th 1891, Townsend was elected Lance-Corporal on November 6th 1893 and Corporal on December 20th 1894.  He was honorably discharged on July 22nd 1898., During the Spanish American War, the 7th NYNG faced controversy for voting unanimously against allowing members to individually enlist in the US Army, as this would have effectively disbanded the unit.  However, New York Governor Frank S. Black (1853-1913) refused the 7th NYNG's various proposals for service that would have allowed the regiment to remain intact.  Townsend desperately wanted to serve his country and was eventually allowed to join Company M of the 201st Infantry Regiment of New York Volunteers as a Captain in July of 1898 after receiving sterling recommendations from commanding officers including Captain Willard C. Fisk (1856-1927) and Colonel Daniel Appleton (1852-1929).  On April 10th 1899, Townsend was appointed a Second Lieutenant in the regular army and received his first assignment a month later with the 1st Infantry Regiment, Company K, stationed at Pinar del Rio and Guanajay, Cuba.  Townsend's mother Emma also appears to have traveled to Cuba as she is identified in select photographs as \"Mrs. Townsend.\", At the outset of the Philippine-American War, the 1st Infantry were ordered to head for Manila.  After a brief stay at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the regiment arrived in San Francisco in late August, 1900, before setting sail for the Philippines.  While in the Philippines, Townsend was primarily deployed in the Eastern Visayas and was for a time the Inspector of Customs at Guiuan, Samar.  During an engagement near Laoang, Samar, Townsend himself survived an ambush in which he was stabbed in the arm.  His detachment also narrowly avoided being sent to Balangiga, where 54 American soldiers were killed in the infamous Balangiga Massacre on September 28th 1901., After his first tour of active duty in the Philippines, Townsend was stationed for a time at Fort Brady in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, in the Department of the Lakes.  However, he and the 1st Infantry were once again sent to the Philippines in January of 1906 and stationed at Camp Stotsenburg, where Townsend was detailed as Aide-de-Camp to Brigadier Generals Walter T. Duggan (1843-1915) and Albert Leopold Mills (1854-1916).  Townsend was subsequently promoted to 1st Lieutenant and later made Captain of Company H of the 23rd Infantry before being reassigned to the 1st Infantry in 1910., Townsend graduated from the Army School of the Line and the Army Staff College in Fort Leavenworth in 1909 and 1910 respectively.  Sometime following his graduation, Townsend was promoted to Lt. Colonel before being appointed to an administrative position at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland.  He married Kathryn McCombs (1879-1973) in Manhattan on December 9th 1916.  In 1923, Townsend was appointed Commandant of Cadets at Ohio State University, a position he held until his retirement from the US Army in 1938.  He had attained the rank of Colonel by the time of his retirement.  Townsend passed away on January 6th 1956 in St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 82., Townsend's written works include the Manual of the Bayonet: United States Army, which he co-authored with Herschel Tupes in 1913.</td>\n",

Low letter book spans July 25, 1840-March 19, 1867 and contains 415 letters in its 466 pages.  It comprises copies and originals of both incoming and outgoing letters that document much of Low's naval career.  Early letters shed light on Low's time onboard the Missouri and the Saratoga and his education at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.  Many pertain to transfers, ship inventories, orders, and the enlistment of crews.  Of particular interest are letters from the period of Low's service with the Union Navy during the Civil War onboard the St. Louis, Constellation, andOctorara.  Both official and personal in nature, they shed light on naval policies, personnel, and Low's wartime experiences., A significant part of the postwar correspondence relates to a bureaucratic error which resulted in the delay of a promotion for Low from the Board of Admirals.  An index appears at the end of the volume., The second William W. Low, Sr., letter book spans 1865-1875, and contains 212 pages of copied incoming and outgoing letters as well as copied passages from books concerning military science and ordnance, and copies of general orders.  The materials pertain to the transportation of supplies, Low's knowledge of ordnance, a proposed article concerning Low for the Army &amp; Navy Journal, Low's recommendations for various navy colleagues, and other subjects.  , The third William W. Low, Sr., letter book spans 1870-1871, and consists of 335 letters within 263 pages.  It comprises writer-retained copies of outgoing letters to correspondents in the U.S. Navy.  Low wrote the letters while onboard the steam sloop-of-war USS Mohican.  His primary correspondents were Rear Admiral John A. Winslow, S.W. Gordon, Rear Admiral Thomas Turner, Commodore William Rogers Taylor, and George M. Robeson.  Topics of the correspondence include health and sanitation, supplies, the condition of the ship, the ventilation of the berth deck, and navy financial matters.  Low also included in his letters summaries of courts martial for theft, intoxication, and the escape of prisoners, as well as information on casualties, training, and transfers.  A series of significant letters in June 1870 record a conflict between San Salvador and Mexico, as well as the capture of the pirate ship Forward., Also included is a volume of compiled circular letters from the U.S. Navy Department, 1870-1875.  Likely kept by William W. Low, Sr., the item contains printed and manuscript letters concerning such topics as courts martial, recordkeeping, uniform regulations, and rank.  The book also includes an index of topics in the front., The first Elisha Peck letter book covers 1843-1863 and contains 30 letters by Peck, most of which he wrote to his wife Grace and children, Evelina (\"Eva\"), Henry, and Joanna (\"Anna\").  Peck wrote 11 of the letters while onboard the U.S. sloop of war Portsmouth from 1849-1851; during this time, Peck commanded the ship as part of an effort to stop the illicit slave trade from West Africa.  In his letters home, he described terrain that he saw from the ship, expressed his sorrow over being separated from his family, and gave accounts of his experiences.  On January 1, 1850, he wrote a letter from Cape Verde, noting that most American and British ships of war took \"on board 20 or 30 African Negroes\" to row in the \"extreme heat of the African sun.\"  He also gave details on the evasive movements of slave traders.  In other letters, Low discussed Ghezo, the King of Dahomey and the kingdom's corps of female soldiers (April 20, 1850); the transportation of beeswax and ivory to the coast of present-day Angola (September 1, 1850); and drinking 100-year old wine on Christmas Day (January 2, 1851).  Peck wrote most of the remainder of the letters while onboard the Carolina off the Brooklyn Navy Yard, discussing naval happenings and social visits and expressing affection for his children.  , The second Elisha Peck letter book contains writer-retained copies of official naval correspondence written by Peck to various correspondents.  The volume spans June 12, 1849-September 1, 1851, and covers the period of Peck's service with the Portsmouth.  Letters concern personnel matters, the compiling of returns, disciplinary matters, and other topics.  Major recipients include Francis Gregory, William B. Preston, William Craig, and William A. Graham. , Note: Two additional letter books by Thomas J. Whittemore are located in the Genealogy series because they contain correspondence related only to family research., The</td>\n",

He worked as a merchant until his arrest by the British in London in 1812, at which time he was pressed into British naval service.  After his exchange in July 1813, he began his career with the United States Navy, acting as master's mate on Gunboat 93.  During his time with the U.S. Navy, which spanned over 40 years, Peck rose up its ranks, eventually reaching the rank of captain.  He served on numerous ships, including the United States, Macedonian, Franklin, Brandywine, Java, Delaware, Falmouth, Dolphin, Natchez, and Grampus.  In 1849, he commanded the USS Portsmouth in an effort to intercept ships involved in the illegal slave trade with West Africa.  In 1855, he was put on the reserve list at the rank of captain.

       "      <td>This collection is made up of diaries, correspondence, documents, scrapbooks, photo albums, negatives, yearbooks, awards, artifacts, and regalia of career U.S. Navy officer David Nash. Much of the content relates to Lieutenant Nash's naval career and his time as a prisoner of war in the Pacific during World War II., The Diaries include two volumes (380 pages) by David Nash, detailing his experiences as a prisoner of war for over three and a half years during World War II.  These are illustrated copies made after the war from original diaries and notes (one of his shipmates buried the first portion of the original diary in a 5-gallon tin can on Luzon in order to recover it later).  Lieut. Nash's almost daily entries reveal his activities, health, mentality and moods, plus information on the activity around him and any rumors or gossip.  Most entries conclude with a note to his \"darlings,\" his wife Honoria and daughter Julie. Detailed illustrations of the prison camps and ships appear throughout the diaries. Nash also included relevant drawings in the margins (guards, a shower, turkey dinner, himself reading, playing cards, etc.)., The first diary is an alphabet-sectioned ledger with 300 lined pages, covering December 1, 1941, to May 29, 1944.  It also contains lists of USS Mindanao personnel and occupants of Barrack #9 Camp.  The diary opens with two watercolor maps of the China Sea entitled \"Cruise of U.S.S. Mindanao, 1941\" and \"Corregidor and Vicinity, 1942.\"  David Nash described his time on Mindanao, stationed at Corregidor during its surrender and capture by the Japanese forces, and as a prisoner of war at Bilibid Prison, Cabanatuan, USAFFE Camp 91st Division, a second time at Bilibid Prison, and the Davao Penal Colony. , The second diary has 80 lined pages and spans October 13, 1944, to October 10, 1944.  This volume continues Nash's account of life as a prisoner of war.  He described his experiences on the hell ship Oryoku Maru, at  Hoten Camp in Mukden, Manchuria, and during the camp's liberation on August 19, 1945. , The Naval Documents, Correspondence and Articles series contains letters, reports, newspaper clippings, personal notes, awards, an illustration, and ephemera relating to David Nash's naval career and POWs in general; the bulk of which ranges between 1934 and 2005.  A portion of the documents in this series relate to the family of a fellow naval officer named Heisinger.,</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Brownell family papers contain correspondence, diaries, documents, writings, illustrations, and other materials documenting the family's experiences from the 1820s into the 1960s., The Correspondence Series includes letters written to and by the Brownell family, primarily in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Louisiana, New York City, Cuba, and France between 1823 and 1969, with the bulk dating from the 1850s to 1940s. , Approximately 296 letters are letters to Charles Brownell and his wife Henrietta [Nettie] from Charles' mother, Lucia [Mummy], and his three brothers, Edward [Ned], Henry, and Clarence, often written with notes added and sent on as a \"round robin\" correspondence which ended with Charles. , \\tThe collection contains over 100 letters written by Ned Brownell, with additional notes in other family members' letters. His earliest letters start when he is finishing medical school in New Orleans and continue with his move to rural Louisiana, near Alexandria and Plaisance. These are high-spirited letters with humorous pen and ink drawings of his adventures chasing wild horses (January 29, 1855); mishaps while duck and geese hunting at Lake Catahoula (November 12, 1855; November 10, 1856); and futile attempts to flag down a river steamer (January 29, 1855). But his letters also deal with the problems involved in setting up a medical practice at the same time he, a Northerner, is trying his hand at cotton cultivation. He married a southern woman of French descent whose father  was a slave owner (19 slaves in 1850 and 30 in 1860). Ned describes bringing up his bilingual children in a culture very different from his own. The marriage s was troubled, and by 1858, he sold out his cotton interests and was considering his brother Clarence's offer to take over Clarence's practice in East Hartford, Connecticut. He moved to Cloutierville, Louisiana, for a while. Two letters of introduction written in 1864 (April 4 and April 25) refer to his allegiance to the Union. By June of 1866, he was involved in legal separation hearings and working with his brothers on a testimony about his wife's \"violent scenes and words.” Both during his practice in Louisiana and later in Rhode Island, his letters describe his patients and treatments (cotton gin accident resulting in amputation of an enslaved person's arm - October 26, 1857; treating yellow fever and typhoid - October 14, 1853 and January 12, 1855). He also suggests treatments for family members with diphtheria (n.d. November 8), excessive menstrual bleeding (December 17, 1866), prolapsed uterus after childbirth (February 8, [1867]), and a prescription for a cholera prevention pill (n.d. September 27). He made a trip to Florida with his dying brother Henry in 1871-1872, in the hopes that the warmer climate might make Henry feel more comfortable., \\tOnly a handful of letters and notes are from Clarence Brownell. Seven of these are affectionate letters to his friend Henrietta Angell [Pierce] [Brownell], before and during her first unhappy marriage. The rest of his letters are to his family and include descriptions of his 1861 visit to Ned and family in Cloutierville, his excitement and satisfaction in building a boat in his workshop, and playing chess by mail with brother Charles. Another letter describes his travels in Egypt. He went by horseback from Alexandria to Cairo, 130 miles across the Delta. A map he drew while with the Pethernick Expedition on the White Nile was sent home posthumously ([May 12], 1862). On it he notes their location by date and the location of certain flora and fauna., \\tOver 100 letters and notes are from Lucia D. Brownell (\"Mummy\"), most of them dealing with local affairs, real estate arrangements, and concerns for her sons' health. Several of these letters mention mediums and the spirit world. After the death of her son Clarence in Egypt, Lucia, Ned, and Henry become interested in reports of mediums and \"spiritual pictures.” One item is a copy of a letter that a medium claimed was dictated to him by Clarence's ghost. Ned describes watching a medium who claimed to see \"words in fiery letters in the illuminated smoke of my cigar when I puffed\" [13 May]. Lucia made several visits to a medium (November- December 1862), ending when the medium was proved a fake., \\tCorrespondence with Henry H. Brownell is well represented. The letters mostly come from Hartford, Connecticut, but letters from Bristol, Rhode Island, are also included. He describes visiting Ned and his family in Louisiana in the 1850s, and accompanying Ned on three of his annual duck and geese hunting expeditions to Lake Catahoula. He seems to have acted as agent for the sale of his brother Charles' paintings when Charles was away in Cuba or Europe - \"two little Charter Oaks for $20.\" [n.d. December 26]. Other letters deal with business matters concerning an inheritance from his grandfather De Wolf involving real estate that he and Charles shared, but unequally. These letters contain little mention of Henry's own writing of poetry and the publication of his books. Two copies of letters to Henry written by Oliver Wendell Holmes praising his work are included [January 13 and February 6, 1865]. A typed copy of a letter from Ernest H. Brownell, dated April 6, 1935, lists letters written by Holmes to Henry H. Brownell. Correspondence to Charles DeWolf Brownell represent his work to honor and publish his brother's writings after his death [late 1880s]., \\tAnother part of the Brownell Papers consists of three batches of letters from abroad - the Procter Wright letters from Europe, the Charles and Nettie Brownell letters from Europe, and the Don Martin Ibarra letters from Cuba and Spain. Procter Wright wrote 25 letters (1876-1884) to Mrs. Charles Brownell (Nettie) from Italy, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. He gives good descriptions of his walking and climbing tours as well as his visits to various cities. A few letters discuss religion, including matters of purgatory [April 28, 1880] and creation or Darwinisn [August 18, 1883]. Wright also mentions the death of the artist Jean Louis Hamon, and the auction of his things [July 26, 1876, December 28, 1876]. He reminds Henrietta how much he treasures Charles' painting of \"Witches' Cork Tree\" that the Brownell's had given him some years earlier [April 9, 1883]., \\tThe twenty letters written by Charles and Nettie in Europe (1872-1874) to family at home talk of their travels, their children, and anything unusual that catches their eye - \"Creche\" day care system in France [August 20, 1873] or a trip to the \"Crystal Palace\" in London [August 29, 1873]. Charles made small pen and ink drawings on three of the letters - a bird on a branch [July 28, 1872], an Egyptian \"cartouche\" [May 6, 1873], and a dental molar [March 27, 1874]. Three other letterheads have hand tinted designs - an animal head [August 9, 1872], a ship [May 8, 1874], and boys on a ship's mast [May 13, 1874]. Two letterheads have landscape lithographs by Henry Besley - \"St. Michael's Mount from Lower Tremenheere\" [August 20, 1873] , \"Penzance from Guvul\" and \"St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall\" [August 22, 1873]., \\tThe Don Martin Ibarra letters (1855-1872) consist of 86 letters written in Spanish to Charles Brownell. They are mainly from Cuba, but the last several are from Barcelona, Spain. They are warm letters to a good friend and \"compadre,” but also contain figures on the production of sugar from at least two \"ingenios\" or sugar mills near the Cardenas area of Cuba., \\tA small group of 17 letters from the poet Lucy Larcom (1862-1870, n.d.) were written to Henrietta Angell Pierce Brownell [Mrs. Charles Brownell], and cover the years of Larcom's decision to stop teaching school and to concentrate her energy on her own writing. Her September 19, 1868, letter mentions proofreading a volume for publication, \"my cricket-chirpings of verse.”, \\tEight letters from Henrietta S. Dana (1861-1863) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Henrietta A. Pierce [Brownell] mention Mrs. Dana helping her famous Yale professor husband by taking dictation from him for his most recent book, Manuel of Geology [April 7, 1862]. Her letters also describe the death of two of their children from diphtheria, and her safely nursing one other child through it [December 21, 1861]., Twenty-five letters from Esther Pierce to her divorced and remarried mother, Henrietta Brownell, were written from 1875-1877, when Esther was 14-16 years old and living with her father, Dr. George Pierce, in Providence. Several years earlier, she had been living with her mother and her step-father, Charles Brownell, and had accompanied them on their trip to Europe. Her nickname was \"Kit,” and she is frequently mentioned in her mother's letters. The letters from Esther [Kit] tell of a trip to Canada, local people and visits, and her new clothes, sometimes with accompanying pen and ink drawings. Two letters include swatches of fabric [February 6, 1876, and April 23, 1876]. , More correspondence to and from the Brownells can be found in the Scrapbook Pages series and the Genealogical Notes and Copies series., Beginning in the 1880s, the correspondence focuses more on Annie May Angell, who would marry Ernest Henry Brownell in 1891, and her family. Virginia McLain (1867-1953), who lived in the Bahamas as the daughter of the United States Consul Thomas J. McClain, was a frequent correspondent into the 1890s. One letter dated October 11, 1887, includes a carte-de-visite of Virginia. Other letters in the 1880s relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell's efforts to publish his brother Henry Howard Brownell's poetry. Several letters from 1882 and 1883 relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell, his work on the Charter Oak, and his paintings. One letter by Oliver Wendell Holmes, dated February 11, 1883, indicates one of Charles' paintings was displayed in his library., Correspondence from the 1890s-1910s centers around Annie May and Ernest Brownell, as well as their family circle and acquaintances. Letters written by Bertha Angell to Lewis Kalloch are also well represented in this period. Ernest's letters provide details about May and Ernest's children and marriage, as well as Ernest's work as a Civil Engineer in the United States Navy. Many of his early letters are addressed from the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Navy Yard. Ernest was also stationed in the Philippines and Bremerton, Washington., Around 1905 Ernest Brownell became involved with the Brownell Building in Providence, Rhode Island, which the brothers inherited, and in the following years corresponded with his brothers Carl and Edward about various matters relating to family properties. Several letters from 1912 refer to a large fire at the Brownell Building., Two items from August 1915 were sent to the family of John K. Rathbone relating to the Galveston Hurricane., Correspondence between Dorothea DeWolf Brownell and Clifford Kyler Rathbone begins around 1918. Clifford Rathbone's letters also detail his career in construction. Material from the 1920s relates to family finances and handling of Kalloch estate matters. By the 1930s letters by Dorinda Rathbone begin appearing, as well as more letters from the Rathbone family, including Myrtle Rathbone of Denton, Texas, and Rosalie Rathbone. , Correspondence from 1942-1943 reflects Clifford Rathbone's unsuccessful efforts to join the military, and Henry B. Rathbone's preparation for the U.S. Naval Academy entrance exams. Following Clifford Rathbone's death in March of 1944, the collection includes many condolence letters. The bulk of the correspondence post-1945 is written to Dorinda Rathbone., The Bundled Correspondence Sub-series is comprised of letters arranged by later descendants of the family. The first bundle of seven letters spans from December 20, 1820, to January 29, 1825, relating to Pardon and Lucia Brownell's inheritance from the estate of Lucia's father Charles DeWolf. It includes notes by Dorothea DeWolf Brownell Rathbone. The second bundle includes 16 letters written to Pardon Brownell enclosed in Florence Brownell's January 19, 1931, letter to Dorothea Rathbone, spanning from March 1825 to December 1835 and primarily concern affairs with a DeWolf family property. One letter from Lucia DeWolf Brownell, dated June 11-13, 1827, is also included. The third bundle consists of 26 letters written from Ernest Brownell to his wife Annie May Angell Brownell from 1904 to 1940, along with a blank postcard and a photograph, likely of Ernest and Annie May, with the inscription \"In Cuba on The Honeymoon, 1891\" written on the verso. The letters commemorate their wedding anniversary, and were written while Ernest was serving in the Navy in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Pensacola, Florida; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and Newport, Rhode Island. The fourth bundle consists of two letters sent by John T. Lewis, Jr., to Dorothea Rathbone in the mid-1960s, enclosing two letters by H. M. K.

Her letters also describe the death of two of their children from diphtheria, and her safely nursing one other child through it [December 21, 1861]., Twenty-five letters from Esther Pierce to her divorced and remarried mother, Henrietta Brownell, were written from 1875-1877, when Esther was 14-16 years old and living with her father, Dr. George Pierce, in Providence. Several years earlier, she had been living with her mother and her step-father, Charles Brownell, and had accompanied them on their trip to Europe. Her nickname was \"Kit,” and she is frequently mentioned in her mother's letters. The letters from Esther [Kit] tell of a trip to Canada, local people and visits, and her new clothes, sometimes with accompanying pen and ink drawings. Two letters include swatches of fabric [February 6, 1876, and April 23, 1876]. , More correspondence to and from the Brownells can be found in the Scrapbook Pages series and the Genealogical Notes and Copies series., Beginning in the 1880s, the correspondence focuses more on Annie May Angell, who would marry Ernest Henry Brownell in 1891, and her family. Virginia McLain (1867-1953), who lived in the Bahamas as the daughter of the United States Consul Thomas J. McClain, was a frequent correspondent into the 1890s. One letter dated October 11, 1887, includes a carte-de-visite of Virginia. Other letters in the 1880s relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell's efforts to publish his brother Henry Howard Brownell's poetry. Several letters from 1882 and 1883 relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell, his work on the Charter Oak, and his paintings. One letter by Oliver Wendell Holmes, dated February 11, 1883, indicates one of Charles' paintings was displayed in his library., Correspondence from the 1890s-1910s centers around Annie May and Ernest Brownell, as well as their family circle and acquaintances. Letters written by Bertha Angell to Lewis Kalloch are also well represented in this period. Ernest's letters provide details about May and Ernest's children and marriage, as well as Ernest's work as a Civil Engineer in the United States Navy. Many of his early letters are addressed from the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Navy Yard. Ernest was also stationed in the Philippines and Bremerton, Washington., Around 1905 Ernest Brownell became involved with the Brownell Building in Providence, Rhode Island, which the brothers inherited, and in the following years corresponded with his brothers Carl and Edward about various matters relating to family properties. Several letters from 1912 refer to a large fire at the Brownell Building., Two items from August 1915 were sent to the family of John K. Rathbone relating to the Galveston Hurricane., Correspondence between Dorothea DeWolf Brownell and Clifford Kyler Rathbone begins around 1918. Clifford Rathbone's letters also detail his career in construction. Material from the 1920s relates to family finances and handling of Kalloch estate matters. By the 1930s letters by Dorinda Rathbone begin appearing, as well as more letters from the Rathbone family, including Myrtle Rathbone of Denton, Texas, and Rosalie Rathbone. , Correspondence from 1942-1943 reflects Clifford Rathbone's unsuccessful efforts to join the military, and Henry B. Rathbone's preparation for the U.S. Naval Academy entrance exams. Following Clifford Rathbone's death in March of 1944, the collection includes many condolence letters. The bulk of the correspondence post-1945 is written to Dorinda Rathbone., The Bundled Correspondence Sub-series is comprised of letters arranged by later descendants of the family. The first bundle of seven letters spans from December 20, 1820, to January 29, 1825, relating to Pardon and Lucia Brownell's inheritance from the estate of Lucia's father Charles DeWolf. It includes notes by Dorothea DeWolf Brownell Rathbone. The second bundle includes 16 letters written to Pardon Brownell enclosed in Florence Brownell's January 19, 1931, letter to Dorothea Rathbone, spanning from March 1825 to December 1835 and primarily concern affairs with a DeWolf family property. One letter from Lucia DeWolf Brownell, dated June 11-13, 1827, is also included. The third bundle consists of 26 letters written from Ernest Brownell to his wife Annie May Angell Brownell from 1904 to 1940, along with a blank postcard and a photograph, likely of Ernest and Annie May, with the inscription \"In Cuba on The Honeymoon, 1891\" written on the verso. The letters commemorate their wedding anniversary, and were written while Ernest was serving in the Navy in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Pensacola, Florida; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and Newport, Rhode Island. The fourth bundle consists of two letters sent by John T. Lewis, Jr., to Dorothea Rathbone in the mid-1960s, enclosing two letters by H. M. K.

       "      <td>Lucia Emilia DeWolf (1795-1884) was born in Bristol, Rhode Island, the daughter of Charles DeWolf and Elizabeth Rogerson. She married Pardon Brownell (1788-1846) in 1815, and had six children by him before he died in 1846. Her first four children were born in Providence, Rhode Island, and the last two in East Hartford, Connecticut. Two of her children died before the age of 16: Francis D. Brownell, her first born (1817-1833), and Emilia D. Brownell, her only daughter (1823-1838). Her surviving children were Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), Edward Rogerson Brownell (1825-1889), and Clarence Melville Brownell (1828-1862). After her husband's death, she moved back and forth between Bristol, Rhode Island, and East Hartford, Connecticut. The 1860 Census lists her as owing $51,500 of real estate. Her son Edward, a physician, made his home with her after his divorce, c.1864., Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), the second child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, studied law, and became a practicing lawyer in Connecticut for a short time, before deciding to concentrate on writing. He published his first volume, Poems, in 1847, but it was as a Civil War poet that he was best known. At his own request, he was allowed to accompany Admiral Farragut into battle, so that he could write about it firsthand. He was made an ensign and acted as Admiral Farragut's secretary. After the Civil War he accompanied Farragut on a European tour. His book, Lyrics of a Day, or Newspaper Poetry, by a Volunteer in Service, was well reviewed by Oliver Wendell Holmes in an article entitled \"Our Battle Laureate\" in the May 1865 issue of the Atlantic Monthly. Holmes continued to encourage his writing efforts. Henry H. Brownell published War Lyrics and Other Poems in 1866, and is one of the people attributed with writing the lyrics for the song \"John Brown's Body.\" He also wrote two popular histories for subscription publishers: The People's Book of Ancient and Modern History in 1851, and The Discoverers, Pioneers, and Settlers of North and South America in 1853. He developed cancer of the face, and underwent surgery in Boston, resulting in the removal of only part of the tumor. His last few years were painful. He made a trip to Florida with his brother Ned (Edward) in 1871-72 where they felt the warmer climate might make Henry more comfortable. At his death, the poet Thomas Bailey Aldrich eulogized him in a short poem, (“Henry Howard Brownell,” Atlantic Monthly, May 1873)., Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), the third child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a landscape artist. He spent seven consecutive winters in Cuba (1854-1861), traveled extensively throughout Europe (1871-1877), to Egypt in 1877, the Caribbean in 1888, and Jamaica in 1894, as well as to various parts of the U.S. Although trained as a lawyer, like his brother Henry, he soon decided against a law career. He took various jobs in Liberty, Virginia, from 1848-1849, and Alexandria, Louisiana, in 1850, and authored a book, The Indian Races of America in 1850, before deciding to concentrate on his painting. He studied with Julius Busch and Joseph Ropes in Hartford. His first works were exhibited at the Hartford Agricultural Society County fair in 1855, and he set up a studio in Hartford in 1857 -1858. In 1860, he moved to New York City and submitted work for sale at the National Academy of Design there in 1861-1862. He married Henrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) after her divorce from Dr. George A. Pierce in 1865 (see biography of Henrietta Knowlton Angell below). When not traveling abroad, they lived in Bristol, Rhode Island, with their four sons: Carl DeWolf Brownell born 1866, Ernest Henry Brownell born 1867, G. Edward Ibarra Brownell born 1870, and Roger Williams Brownell born 1876. His step daughter, Esther Pierce (b. 1860), sometimes lived with the family. His most well-known painting is \"The Connecticut Charter Oak.”, \\tEdward Rogerson Brownell [Ned] (1825-1889), the fifth child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a physician like his father. He attended medical school in New Orleans, and was made a visiting physician at the Charity Hospital there while still a student. He took his diploma exam in 1850, and moved to rural Plaisance, Louisiana, where he married Pamela Laysard (b. in 1838, daughter of Malafret Laysard) in 1853. Edward tried to combine his medical practice in rural Louisiana with raising cotton, but had little success in the cotton business. He and Pamela had six children before they became embroiled in a bitter separation. The oldest child, Francis (b. 1854), came back East with his father prior to 1866, and in the 1880 Census was living with a great aunt in Hartford, Connecticut. The other four living children (Lucia b. 1857, Arthur b. 1859, Clarence b. 1860, and Charles b. 1862) stayed in Louisiana with their mother. The 1910 Census lists Pamela L. Brownell as living in Rapides County, Louisiana, at age 70, with only one of her six children still alive. Edward [Ned] spent the years after his marital separation living with his mother in Bristol, Rhode Island, and is listed in the 1880 Census as an \"alopathic physician\"., \\tClarence Melville Brownell, the youngest child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was born May 2, 1828, in East Harford, Connecticut, and died in May 1862, on the White Nile River in Central Africa [Lat. 8 N.] at the age of 34. He never married. Despite being trained as a physician and having built up a thriving medical practice in East Hartford (1853-1859), he had a strong desire to travel to remote areas. In November 1859, he left for Callao, Peru, and made a trip down the Amazon. In 1860, he traveled to St. Thomas and Cuba. In 1861 he visited his brother Ned in rural Cloutierville, Louisiana, and then left for Alexandria, Egypt, via Marseille, expecting to be gone two years. In late October a letter was forwarded to him in Marseille offering him a captaincy in a Connecticut Regiment, which he had been most eager to have. But, because he had already begun his trip to Egypt, he decided to go on. In Khartoum he met John Pethernick and joined his expedition to the source of the White Nile, agreeing to make botanical collections for them. Brownell kept a diary from January 1, 1862, to May 13, 1862 [typescript at the University of Durham, England], describing his travels, as well as the flora and fauna he encountered. The diary ended about a week before his death when he became too ill to write. John Pethernick's wife wrote an account of his death in Travels in Central Africa, published in 1869 in London., \\tHenrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) was the daughter of Henry Angell and Rebecca Knowlton of Rhode Island. She married Dr. George A. Pierce in February 1859. They had two children, Esther H. Pierce (b. 1860) and Henry A. Pierce (1863-1867), before divorcing. In 1865, Henrietta married the artist Charles DeWolf Brownell, by whom she had four sons: Carl D. Brownell, b. 1866; Ernest Henry Brownell, b. 1867; G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell, b.1870; and Roger Williams Brownell, b. 1876. She and the children accompanied Charles to Europe in the 1870s. At some point she converted to Catholicism, and published two long stories in serial form in the journal Catholic World. One was called Donna Quixote (1882) and the other Out of the West (1883). She also wrote God's Way, Man's Way - A History of Bristol, Rhode Island, and submitted articles to the Phoenix. It was at her request and with her financial support that four Sisters of Mercy from Providence, Rhode Island, were sent across to Newfoundland's west coast to found the first Sisters of Mercy house there in 1893., Henritetta Knowlton Angell and Charles DeWolf Brownell's son Ernest Henry Brownell was born in 1867. He graduated from Brown University in 1888 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890. He was an instructor in civil engineering at Brown University in the 1890s. Beginning in 1902, he served as an officer in the United States Navy Civil Engineer Corps, holding positions at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; New York, New York; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Florida; and Washington, D.C. In 1891 he married Annie May Angell (1866-1958). Together they had four children: John Angell Brownell (1892-1977), Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982), Margaret Knowlton Brownell (1895-1977), and Thomas Church Brownell (1898-1953). He died in 1945 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island., Annie May Angell Brownell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1866 to John Arnold Angell (1837-1877) and Annie Wardwell Usher Angell (1840-1898). Her siblings included Bertha Angell (1868-1928), John Wardwell Angell (1870-1927), and Elsie Angell (1875-1877). Her paternal grandparents were John Angell (b. 1794) and Nancy Arnold Angell (1798-1876). From 1910 to 1940, she is listed in the United States Federal Censuses as a patient in the Butler Hospital for the Insane. She died in 1958 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island., Bertha Angell, born in 1868, was Annie May Angell Brownell's sister. In 1902 she married Lewis Howe Kalloch (b. 1867), a dentist, and in 1904 she gave birth to Lewis Howe Kalloch, Jr. They appear to have been involved in business with Ernest and Annie May Brownell. She died in 1928., Annie May Angell Brownell and Ernest Henry Brownell's daughter Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982) graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. She married Clifford Kyler Rathbone (1893-1944) in 1923. Clifford's parents were John K. Rathbone and Myrtle Petty Rathbone of Denton, Texas. Clifford Rathbone worked in construction, listed as a contractor in the 1930 United States Federal Census and an architectural engineer in 1940. He had at least one sibling, Rosalie Rathbone (1891-1976), who married William A. Craft (1894-1963) in 1950. Both Rosalie and William Craft taught at Iowa State. , Together Dorothea and Clifford Rathbone had two children, Dorinda Rathbone (1924-2009) and Henry Brownell Rathbone (1925-1951). Dorinda Rathbone attended the University of Washington and married Carlos Dew, Jr., in 1946. Henry Rathbone graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. He was killed during the Korean War while serving in the United States Navy., Other figures in the collection are noted below. , \\tProcer Wright was probably an Englishman.  He seems to have met Charles and Henrietta Brownell in San Raphael, France, in 1876.  He and Henrietta Brownell became friends and corresponded between 1876 and 1884, when Wright was traveling through Europe. , \\tDon Manuel Ibarra was a Spaniard married to a Cuban woman.  He worked at the San Martin sugar refinery (\"ingenio\") near Cardenas, Cuba.  He was probably the refinery manager, but could have been a partial owner.  He worked in Cuba from 1855-1870, returning to Barcelona, Spain, by 1871, perhaps because of the unrest caused by the Cuban \"Ten-Year War\" which started in October of 1868 and involved bloody clashes between Cuban independence seekers and Spanish troops.  Ibarra met Charles Brownell in Cuba. They became such close friends that Brownell named his third son born in 1870, after Ibarra (G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell)., \\tLucy Larcom (1824-1893) was a poet, author and editor.  She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Larcom and Lois Barrett.  After her father's death, the family moved to Lowell, where her mother kept a boarding house, and Lucy worked in the mills for ten years.  Through a literary club at the mills, she met John G. Whittier who encouraged her to write.  She accompanied a married sister to Illinois where she taught school for three years before attending Monticello Female Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, for three years.  She returned to Beverly, Massachusetts, and taught for six years at Wheaton Female Seminary, where she met Henrietta Angell [Brownell]. When her health began to fail, she resigned and took a position editing the children's magazine Our Young Folks.  She continued to write and publish her own poetry and prose.  She never married., \\tHenrietta Silliman Dana (1823-1907) was the daughter of Benjamin Silliman, a professor at Yale, and Harriet Trumbell.  In 1844, she married James Dwight Dana who became a renown professor of geology at Yale.  He accompanied the Charles Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific in the early 1840's, and then became Silliman Professor of Natural History and Geology at Yale until several years before he died in 1895.  He wrote classical works on geology and mineralogy.  The Danas had six children, but lost two of them to diphtheria in 1861.  Their son, Edward (b. 1849), also became a professor at Yale.</td>\n",

In November 1859, he left for Callao, Peru, and made a trip down the Amazon. In 1860, he traveled to St. Thomas and Cuba. In 1861 he visited his brother Ned in rural Cloutierville, Louisiana, and then left for Alexandria, Egypt, via Marseille, expecting to be gone two years. In late October a letter was forwarded to him in Marseille offering him a captaincy in a Connecticut Regiment, which he had been most eager to have. But, because he had already begun his trip to Egypt, he decided to go on. In Khartoum he met John Pethernick and joined his expedition to the source of the White Nile, agreeing to make botanical collections for them. Brownell kept a diary from January 1, 1862, to May 13, 1862 [typescript at the University of Durham, England], describing his travels, as well as the flora and fauna he encountered. The diary ended about a week before his death when he became too ill to write. John Pethernick's wife wrote an account of his death in Travels in Central Africa, published in 1869 in London., \\tHenrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) was the daughter of Henry Angell and Rebecca Knowlton of Rhode Island. She married Dr. George A. Pierce in February 1859. They had two children, Esther H. Pierce (b. 1860) and Henry A. Pierce (1863-1867), before divorcing. In 1865, Henrietta married the artist Charles DeWolf Brownell, by whom she had four sons: Carl D. Brownell, b. 1866; Ernest Henry Brownell, b. 1867; G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell, b.1870; and Roger Williams Brownell, b. 1876. She and the children accompanied Charles to Europe in the 1870s. At some point she converted to Catholicism, and published two long stories in serial form in the journal Catholic World. One was called Donna Quixote (1882) and the other Out of the West (1883). She also wrote God's Way, Man's Way - A History of Bristol, Rhode Island, and submitted articles to the Phoenix. It was at her request and with her financial support that four Sisters of Mercy from Providence, Rhode Island, were sent across to Newfoundland's west coast to found the first Sisters of Mercy house there in 1893., Henritetta Knowlton Angell and Charles DeWolf Brownell's son Ernest Henry Brownell was born in 1867. He graduated from Brown University in 1888 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890. He was an instructor in civil engineering at Brown University in the 1890s. Beginning in 1902, he served as an officer in the United States Navy Civil Engineer Corps, holding positions at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; New York, New York; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Florida; and Washington, D.C. In 1891 he married Annie May Angell (1866-1958). Together they had four children: John Angell Brownell (1892-1977), Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982), Margaret Knowlton Brownell (1895-1977), and Thomas Church Brownell (1898-1953). He died in 1945 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island., Annie May Angell Brownell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1866 to John Arnold Angell (1837-1877) and Annie Wardwell Usher Angell (1840-1898). Her siblings included Bertha Angell (1868-1928), John Wardwell Angell (1870-1927), and Elsie Angell (1875-1877). Her paternal grandparents were John Angell (b. 1794) and Nancy Arnold Angell (1798-1876). From 1910 to 1940, she is listed in the United States Federal Censuses as a patient in the Butler Hospital for the Insane. She died in 1958 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island., Bertha Angell, born in 1868, was Annie May Angell Brownell's sister. In 1902 she married Lewis Howe Kalloch (b. 1867), a dentist, and in 1904 she gave birth to Lewis Howe Kalloch, Jr. They appear to have been involved in business with Ernest and Annie May Brownell. She died in 1928., Annie May Angell Brownell and Ernest Henry Brownell's daughter Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982) graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. She married Clifford Kyler Rathbone (1893-1944) in 1923. Clifford's parents were John K. Rathbone and Myrtle Petty Rathbone of Denton, Texas. Clifford Rathbone worked in construction, listed as a contractor in the 1930 United States Federal Census and an architectural engineer in 1940. He had at least one sibling, Rosalie Rathbone (1891-1976), who married William A. Craft (1894-1963) in 1950. Both Rosalie and William Craft taught at Iowa State. , Together Dorothea and Clifford Rathbone had two children, Dorinda Rathbone (1924-2009) and Henry Brownell Rathbone (1925-1951). Dorinda Rathbone attended the University of Washington and married Carlos Dew, Jr., in 1946. Henry Rathbone graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. He was killed during the Korean War while serving in the United States Navy., Other figures in the collection are noted below. , \\tProcer Wright was probably an Englishman.  He seems to have met Charles and Henrietta Brownell in San Raphael, France, in 1876.  He and Henrietta Brownell became friends and corresponded between 1876 and 1884, when Wright was traveling through Europe. , \\tDon Manuel Ibarra was a Spaniard married to a Cuban woman.  He worked at the San Martin sugar refinery (\"ingenio\") near Cardenas, Cuba.  He was probably the refinery manager, but could have been a partial owner.  He worked in Cuba from 1855-1870, returning to Barcelona, Spain, by 1871, perhaps because of the unrest caused by the Cuban \"Ten-Year War\" which started in October of 1868 and involved bloody clashes between Cuban independence seekers and Spanish troops.  Ibarra met Charles Brownell in Cuba. They became such close friends that Brownell named his third son born in 1870, after Ibarra (G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell)., \\tLucy Larcom (1824-1893) was a poet, author and editor.  She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Larcom and Lois Barrett.  After her father's death, the family moved to Lowell, where her mother kept a boarding house, and Lucy worked in the mills for ten years.  Through a literary club at the mills, she met John G. Whittier who encouraged her to write.  She accompanied a married sister to Illinois where she taught school for three years before attending Monticello Female Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, for three years.  She returned to Beverly, Massachusetts, and taught for six years at Wheaton Female Seminary, where she met Henrietta Angell [Brownell]. When her health began to fail, she resigned and took a position editing the children's magazine Our Young Folks.  She continued to write and publish her own poetry and prose.  She never married., \\tHenrietta Silliman Dana (1823-1907) was the daughter of Benjamin Silliman, a professor at Yale, and Harriet Trumbell.  In 1844, she married James Dwight Dana who became a renown professor of geology at Yale.  He accompanied the Charles Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific in the early 1840's, and then became Silliman Professor of Natural History and Geology at Yale until several years before he died in 1895.  He wrote classical works on geology and mineralogy.  The Danas had six children, but lost two of them to diphtheria in 1861.  Their son, Edward (b. 1849), also became a professor at Yale.</td>\n",

       "0            , Russell Alexander Alger's uncle, David Baker Alger, married Margaret Richardson in the early 19th century, and by the mid-1800s the couple had settled in Richfield, Ohio.  They had four children, including:  Albert W. (b. 1849) and Richard Edwin (\"R. E.\" or \"Eddy\") Alger (1854-1943).  Albert resided in Colony, Kansas, in the early 20th century, and Richard remained in Richfield for most or all of his life.  Richard married Esther D. Reynolds, a strongly spiritual woman, on October 4, 1888.  The couple's children included Emma, Mary, Esther Marion, Margaret (b. 1890), and David Bruce (b. December 8, 1891).  , David Bruce Alger attended Oberlin College in the early 1910s.  He graduated and had moved to Cleveland, Ohio, by 1916.  He married Clare Fleeman on October 13, 1916.  David Alger worked in the banking industry for much of his life and kept a series of short daily diaries from 1910 until 1973, which documented his time in Ohio, Texas, Missouri, and Florida.  Clare, an aspiring poet and writer, contributed to a variety of religious and literary publications throughout her life and was a member of the St. Louis Writers' Guild in the 1940s., David Bruce and Clare Fleeman Alger's son, Bruce Reynolds Alger, was born in Dallas, Texas, on June 12, 1918. The family moved to Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Bruce Alger shared his father's love for football, played for his high school football team, and, later, on Princeton University's squad.  Following his graduation from Princeton (1940) and a brief stint as a field representative for the RCA Victor Manufacturing Company, Bruce enlisted in the Army Air Corps after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  He was stationed with the Fifth Squadron at the Army Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kerry Field, Texas, and he spent much of the war in training throughout the United States.  Bruce did see action in the Pacific theater in 1945, and spent time in Japan soon after the Japanese surrender.  Bruce received his discharge in November 1945, settled in Dallas, and pursued a career in real estate.  He later represented Texas' 5th District in the United States House of Representatives (1955-1965).  He returned to his real estate business in Dallas after a failed reelection bid.

Also present are copies of treaties and reports on the military and trade capabilities of many of these nations.

       "7            , At home, Jane's new job responsibilities brought her into contact with a supervisor and colleague whom she did not like. She tried to work out differences peacefully but still felt that she ended up doing more work than they, adding to the difficulty she felt in the need to balance her work and keeping house: \"Sometimes I wonder whether I'm doing a good job of housekeeping, and whether it will be the way you'd like to find it when you return. I know it's not a perfect job, but I excuse it by saying that you can't hold down two jobs and do them both perfectly.\" Jane felt obligated to spend time with both her own family and Johnson's. To help ease the situation, Jane's mother suggested she move home until the war ended \"to save money.\" However Jane wanted to maintain her independence and refused. , The effects of rationing were painfully evident during the holidays. \"Turkeys were very scarce this year. You could get them through black markets at about $1 a pound, and some few people were able to get them at a legitimate price...\" Cigarettes and sugar were scarce as well. Jane regretted that butter, milk, and eggs were considered part of the meat ration. Her neighbor down the hall often procured meat for her because she had a butcher who would sell her extra. The black market flourished. , While billeted in Stolberg, Germany, Johnson also complained of shortages: \"Certain war correspondents has said the shell shortage is not due so much to the lack of production as failure to foresee the tremendous need--whatever the cause we need stuff--now!\" He mentioned that work strikes by war plant workers made him furious because the soldiers suffered from the shortage of ammunitions. , On December 16, 1944, the Germans mustered their forces for a last major offensive in the Ardennes. On Christmas day, just five kilometers from the front, Johnson wrote his wife to tell her that he had saved her packages to open on Christmas, although in reality, he had already opened them fearing that he would not live until Christmas. Johnson survived the Battle of the Bulge, earning a Bronze Star in the process. , Johnson's company liberated Nordhausen, one of the concentration camps in Germany in early April 1945, near the end of the war. He was horrified by the sight: \"Nearly 500 foreign slave laborers were lying in filth nearly dead from starvation in town.\" What he saw in Germany piqued his hatred of the German civilians, and he complained of a \"feeling of disgust\" when seeing German civilians: \"They collect pictures of Hitler and the Luftwaffe. When they cry now that such and such is a hardship, I feel like telling them to write a letter to Hitler.\" , With the war in Europe ended in May, 1945, Johnson desperately longed to return home, but did not have enough points to do so. He remained in Germany through the summer and fall, billeted in Egelsbach, where he set up a beer hall for officers and enlisted men, and where they even served lunch. Due in part to his Bronze Star, Johnson was promoted to Master Sergeant before boarding the Montclair Victory Ship on October 19 1945, bound for the States. , Upon learning that the war was over, Johnson told his wife to quit her job immediately, reasoning that he would be able to stay at the job he had left working for a textile company. The couple wanted to start a family as soon as possible.

       "10  Grosvenor Lowery Townsend (1874-1956) was born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents Malcolm (1847-?) and Emma Virginia Townsend (1849-?).  First joining the ranks of the New York National Guard, 7th Regiment, Company D, on September 29th 1891, Townsend was elected Lance-Corporal on November 6th 1893 and Corporal on December 20th 1894.  He was honorably discharged on July 22nd 1898., During the Spanish American War, the 7th NYNG faced controversy for voting unanimously against allowing members to individually enlist in the US Army, as this would have effectively disbanded the unit.  However, New York Governor Frank S. Black (1853-1913) refused the 7th NYNG's various proposals for service that would have allowed the regiment to remain intact.  Townsend desperately wanted to serve his country and was eventually allowed to join Company M of the 201st Infantry Regiment of New York Volunteers as a Captain in July of 1898 after receiving sterling recommendations from commanding officers including Captain Willard C. Fisk (1856-1927) and Colonel Daniel Appleton (1852-1929).  On April 10th 1899, Townsend was appointed a Second Lieutenant in the regular army and received his first assignment a month later with the 1st Infantry Regiment, Company K, stationed at Pinar del Rio and Guanajay, Cuba.  Townsend's mother Emma also appears to have traveled to Cuba as she is identified in select photographs as \"Mrs. Townsend.\", At the outset of the Philippine-American War, the 1st Infantry were ordered to head for Manila.  After a brief stay at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the regiment arrived in San Francisco in late August, 1900, before setting sail for the Philippines.  While in the Philippines, Townsend was primarily deployed in the Eastern Visayas and was for a time the Inspector of Customs at Guiuan, Samar.  During an engagement near Laoang, Samar, Townsend himself survived an ambush in which he was stabbed in the arm.  His detachment also narrowly avoided being sent to Balangiga, where 54 American soldiers were killed in the infamous Balangiga Massacre on September 28th 1901., After his first tour of active duty in the Philippines, Townsend was stationed for a time at Fort Brady in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, in the Department of the Lakes.  However, he and the 1st Infantry were once again sent to the Philippines in January of 1906 and stationed at Camp Stotsenburg, where Townsend was detailed as Aide-de-Camp to Brigadier Generals Walter T. Duggan (1843-1915) and Albert Leopold Mills (1854-1916).  Townsend was subsequently promoted to 1st Lieutenant and later made Captain of Company H of the 23rd Infantry before being reassigned to the 1st Infantry in 1910., Townsend graduated from the Army School of the Line and the Army Staff College in Fort Leavenworth in 1909 and 1910 respectively.  Sometime following his graduation, Townsend was promoted to Lt. Colonel before being appointed to an administrative position at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland.  He married Kathryn McCombs (1879-1973) in Manhattan on December 9th 1916.  In 1923, Townsend was appointed Commandant of Cadets at Ohio State University, a position he held until his retirement from the US Army in 1938.  He had attained the rank of Colonel by the time of his retirement.  Townsend passed away on January 6th 1956 in St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 82., Townsend's written works include the Manual of the Bayonet: United States Army, which he co-authored with Herschel Tupes in 1913.

       "11  George Macartney was born in Ireland on May 3, 1737, the son of George Macartney and Elizabeth Winder.  He attended Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, in the 1750s, and earned his master's degree in 1759.  In the 1760s and early 1770s, he served in the Irish parliament; he was envoy extraordinary and ambassador to Russia, and later served in Ireland as chief secretary to Field Marshal George Townshend.  On February 1, 1768, he married Lady Jane Stuart (1742-1828), the daughter of former prime minister John Stuart, third Earl of Bute (1713-1792), and Mary Wortley Montagu (1718--1794).  Macartney traveled to the Caribbean in 1776 and served as governor of Grenada, Tobago, and the Grenadines until 1779, when he was imprisoned following the French invasion of Grenada.  After his return to Great Britain, he was governor of Madras (1781-1785) and a diplomat to China and the Cape Colony (in what is now South Africa).  He received an earldom in 1794.  George Macartney died on March 31, 1806.

       "13               contains four letter books by William Whittemore Low, Sr., between 1840 and 1875, and two kept by Elisha Peck, 1843-1863.  The earliest William W. Low letter book spans July 25, 1840-March 19, 1867 and contains 415 letters in its 466 pages.  It comprises copies and originals of both incoming and outgoing letters that document much of Low's naval career.  Early letters shed light on Low's time onboard the Missouri and the Saratoga and his education at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.  Many pertain to transfers, ship inventories, orders, and the enlistment of crews.  Of particular interest are letters from the period of Low's service with the Union Navy during the Civil War onboard the St. Louis, Constellation, andOctorara.  Both official and personal in nature, they shed light on naval policies, personnel, and Low's wartime experiences., A significant part of the postwar correspondence relates to a bureaucratic error which resulted in the delay of a promotion for Low from the Board of Admirals.  An index appears at the end of the volume., The second William W. Low, Sr., letter book spans 1865-1875, and contains 212 pages of copied incoming and outgoing letters as well as copied passages from books concerning military science and ordnance, and copies of general orders.  The materials pertain to the transportation of supplies, Low's knowledge of ordnance, a proposed article concerning Low for the Army & Navy Journal, Low's recommendations for various navy colleagues, and other subjects.  , The third William W. Low, Sr., letter book spans 1870-1871, and consists of 335 letters within 263 pages.  It comprises writer-retained copies of outgoing letters to correspondents in the U.S. Navy.  Low wrote the letters while onboard the steam sloop-of-war USS Mohican.  His primary correspondents were Rear Admiral John A. Winslow, S.W. Gordon, Rear Admiral Thomas Turner, Commodore William Rogers Taylor, and George M. Robeson.  Topics of the correspondence include health and sanitation, supplies, the condition of the ship, the ventilation of the berth deck, and navy financial matters.  Low also included in his letters summaries of courts martial for theft, intoxication, and the escape of prisoners, as well as information on casualties, training, and transfers.  A series of significant letters in June 1870 record a conflict between San Salvador and Mexico, as well as the capture of the pirate ship Forward., Also included is a volume of compiled circular letters from the U.S. Navy Department, 1870-1875.  Likely kept by William W. Low, Sr., the item contains printed and manuscript letters concerning such topics as courts martial, recordkeeping, uniform regulations, and rank.  The book also includes an index of topics in the front., The first Elisha Peck letter book covers 1843-1863 and contains 30 letters by Peck, most of which he wrote to his wife Grace and children, Evelina (\"Eva\"), Henry, and Joanna (\"Anna\").  Peck wrote 11 of the letters while onboard the U.S. sloop of war Portsmouth from 1849-1851; during this time, Peck commanded the ship as part of an effort to stop the illicit slave trade from West Africa.  In his letters home, he described terrain that he saw from the ship, expressed his sorrow over being separated from his family, and gave accounts of his experiences.  On January 1, 1850, he wrote a letter from Cape Verde, noting that most American and British ships of war took \"on board 20 or 30 African Negroes\" to row in the \"extreme heat of the African sun.\"  He also gave details on the evasive movements of slave traders.  In other letters, Low discussed Ghezo, the King of Dahomey and the kingdom's corps of female soldiers (April 20, 1850); the transportation of beeswax and ivory to the coast of present-day Angola (September 1, 1850); and drinking 100-year old wine on Christmas Day (January 2, 1851).  Peck wrote most of the remainder of the letters while onboard the Carolina off the Brooklyn Navy Yard, discussing naval happenings and social visits and expressing affection for his children.  , The second Elisha Peck letter book contains writer-retained copies of official naval correspondence written by Peck to various correspondents.  The volume spans June 12, 1849-September 1, 1851, and covers the period of Peck's service with the Portsmouth.  Letters concern personnel matters, the compiling of returns, disciplinary matters, and other topics.  Major recipients include Francis Gregory, William B. Preston, William Craig, and William A. Graham. , Note: Two additional letter books by Thomas J. Whittemore are located in the Genealogy series because they contain correspondence related only to family research., The

       "14           , Elisha Peck was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on May 5, 1790, the son of Henry Peck and Hannah Lewis.  Peck first went to sea around 1803 as a cabin-boy on the brig Argus.  He worked as a merchant until his arrest by the British in London in 1812, at which time he was pressed into British naval service.  After his exchange in July 1813, he began his career with the United States Navy, acting as master's mate on Gunboat 93.  During his time with the U.S. Navy, which spanned over 40 years, Peck rose up its ranks, eventually reaching the rank of captain.  He served on numerous ships, including the United States, Macedonian, Franklin, Brandywine, Java, Delaware, Falmouth, Dolphin, Natchez, and Grampus.  In 1849, he commanded the USS Portsmouth in an effort to intercept ships involved in the illegal slave trade with West Africa.  In 1855, he was put on the reserve list at the rank of captain.  He died on June 11, 1866.  , Peck married Grace Bonticou (b. 1805), daughter of James Bonticou and Joanna Clark, on June 14, 1831.  The couple had three children: Evelina (b. 1836) who married William W. Low; Henry (b. 1839); and Joanna (b. ca. 1841), who married James Madison Whittemore, Jr.

       "15  This collection is made up of diaries, correspondence, documents, scrapbooks, photo albums, negatives, yearbooks, awards, artifacts, and regalia of career U.S. Navy officer David Nash. Much of the content relates to Lieutenant Nash's naval career and his time as a prisoner of war in the Pacific during World War II., The Diaries include two volumes (380 pages) by David Nash, detailing his experiences as a prisoner of war for over three and a half years during World War II.  These are illustrated copies made after the war from original diaries and notes (one of his shipmates buried the first portion of the original diary in a 5-gallon tin can on Luzon in order to recover it later).  Lieut. Nash's almost daily entries reveal his activities, health, mentality and moods, plus information on the activity around him and any rumors or gossip.  Most entries conclude with a note to his \"darlings,\" his wife Honoria and daughter Julie. Detailed illustrations of the prison camps and ships appear throughout the diaries. Nash also included relevant drawings in the margins (guards, a shower, turkey dinner, himself reading, playing cards, etc.)., The first diary is an alphabet-sectioned ledger with 300 lined pages, covering December 1, 1941, to May 29, 1944.  It also contains lists of USS Mindanao personnel and occupants of Barrack #9 Camp.  The diary opens with two watercolor maps of the China Sea entitled \"Cruise of U.S.S. Mindanao, 1941\" and \"Corregidor and Vicinity, 1942.\"  David Nash described his time on Mindanao, stationed at Corregidor during its surrender and capture by the Japanese forces, and as a prisoner of war at Bilibid Prison, Cabanatuan, USAFFE Camp 91st Division, a second time at Bilibid Prison, and the Davao Penal Colony. , The second diary has 80 lined pages and spans October 13, 1944, to October 10, 1944.  This volume continues Nash's account of life as a prisoner of war.  He described his experiences on the hell ship Oryoku Maru, at  Hoten Camp in Mukden, Manchuria, and during the camp's liberation on August 19, 1945. , The Naval Documents, Correspondence and Articles series contains letters, reports, newspaper clippings, personal notes, awards, an illustration, and ephemera relating to David Nash's naval career and POWs in general; the bulk of which ranges between 1934 and 2005.  A portion of the documents in this series relate to the family of a fellow naval officer named Heisinger.,

       "16  The Brownell family papers contain correspondence, diaries, documents, writings, illustrations, and other materials documenting the family's experiences from the 1820s into the 1960s., The Correspondence Series includes letters written to and by the Brownell family, primarily in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Louisiana, New York City, Cuba, and France between 1823 and 1969, with the bulk dating from the 1850s to 1940s. , Approximately 296 letters are letters to Charles Brownell and his wife Henrietta [Nettie] from Charles' mother, Lucia [Mummy], and his three brothers, Edward [Ned], Henry, and Clarence, often written with notes added and sent on as a \"round robin\" correspondence which ended with Charles. , \\tThe collection contains over 100 letters written by Ned Brownell, with additional notes in other family members' letters. His earliest letters start when he is finishing medical school in New Orleans and continue with his move to rural Louisiana, near Alexandria and Plaisance. These are high-spirited letters with humorous pen and ink drawings of his adventures chasing wild horses (January 29, 1855); mishaps while duck and geese hunting at Lake Catahoula (November 12, 1855; November 10, 1856); and futile attempts to flag down a river steamer (January 29, 1855). But his letters also deal with the problems involved in setting up a medical practice at the same time he, a Northerner, is trying his hand at cotton cultivation. He married a southern woman of French descent whose father  was a slave owner (19 slaves in 1850 and 30 in 1860). Ned describes bringing up his bilingual children in a culture very different from his own. The marriage s was troubled, and by 1858, he sold out his cotton interests and was considering his brother Clarence's offer to take over Clarence's practice in East Hartford, Connecticut. He moved to Cloutierville, Louisiana, for a while. Two letters of introduction written in 1864 (April 4 and April 25) refer to his allegiance to the Union. By June of 1866, he was involved in legal separation hearings and working with his brothers on a testimony about his wife's \"violent scenes and words.” Both during his practice in Louisiana and later in Rhode Island, his letters describe his patients and treatments (cotton gin accident resulting in amputation of an enslaved person's arm - October 26, 1857; treating yellow fever and typhoid - October 14, 1853 and January 12, 1855). He also suggests treatments for family members with diphtheria (n.d. November 8), excessive menstrual bleeding (December 17, 1866), prolapsed uterus after childbirth (February 8, [1867]), and a prescription for a cholera prevention pill (n.d. September 27). He made a trip to Florida with his dying brother Henry in 1871-1872, in the hopes that the warmer climate might make Henry feel more comfortable., \\tOnly a handful of letters and notes are from Clarence Brownell. Seven of these are affectionate letters to his friend Henrietta Angell [Pierce] [Brownell], before and during her first unhappy marriage. The rest of his letters are to his family and include descriptions of his 1861 visit to Ned and family in Cloutierville, his excitement and satisfaction in building a boat in his workshop, and playing chess by mail with brother Charles. Another letter describes his travels in Egypt. He went by horseback from Alexandria to Cairo, 130 miles across the Delta. A map he drew while with the Pethernick Expedition on the White Nile was sent home posthumously ([May 12], 1862). On it he notes their location by date and the location of certain flora and fauna., \\tOver 100 letters and notes are from Lucia D. Brownell (\"Mummy\"), most of them dealing with local affairs, real estate arrangements, and concerns for her sons' health. Several of these letters mention mediums and the spirit world. After the death of her son Clarence in Egypt, Lucia, Ned, and Henry become interested in reports of mediums and \"spiritual pictures.” One item is a copy of a letter that a medium claimed was dictated to him by Clarence's ghost. Ned describes watching a medium who claimed to see \"words in fiery letters in the illuminated smoke of my cigar when I puffed\" [13 May]. Lucia made several visits to a medium (November- December 1862), ending when the medium was proved a fake., \\tCorrespondence with Henry H. Brownell is well represented. The letters mostly come from Hartford, Connecticut, but letters from Bristol, Rhode Island, are also included. He describes visiting Ned and his family in Louisiana in the 1850s, and accompanying Ned on three of his annual duck and geese hunting expeditions to Lake Catahoula. He seems to have acted as agent for the sale of his brother Charles' paintings when Charles was away in Cuba or Europe - \"two little Charter Oaks for $20.\" [n.d. December 26]. Other letters deal with business matters concerning an inheritance from his grandfather De Wolf involving real estate that he and Charles shared, but unequally. These letters contain little mention of Henry's own writing of poetry and the publication of his books. Two copies of letters to Henry written by Oliver Wendell Holmes praising his work are included [January 13 and February 6, 1865]. A typed copy of a letter from Ernest H. Brownell, dated April 6, 1935, lists letters written by Holmes to Henry H. Brownell. Correspondence to Charles DeWolf Brownell represent his work to honor and publish his brother's writings after his death [late 1880s]., \\tAnother part of the Brownell Papers consists of three batches of letters from abroad - the Procter Wright letters from Europe, the Charles and Nettie Brownell letters from Europe, and the Don Martin Ibarra letters from Cuba and Spain. Procter Wright wrote 25 letters (1876-1884) to Mrs. Charles Brownell (Nettie) from Italy, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. He gives good descriptions of his walking and climbing tours as well as his visits to various cities. A few letters discuss religion, including matters of purgatory [April 28, 1880] and creation or Darwinisn [August 18, 1883]. Wright also mentions the death of the artist Jean Louis Hamon, and the auction of his things [July 26, 1876, December 28, 1876]. He reminds Henrietta how much he treasures Charles' painting of \"Witches' Cork Tree\" that the Brownell's had given him some years earlier [April 9, 1883]., \\tThe twenty letters written by Charles and Nettie in Europe (1872-1874) to family at home talk of their travels, their children, and anything unusual that catches their eye - \"Creche\" day care system in France [August 20, 1873] or a trip to the \"Crystal Palace\" in London [August 29, 1873]. Charles made small pen and ink drawings on three of the letters - a bird on a branch [July 28, 1872], an Egyptian \"cartouche\" [May 6, 1873], and a dental molar [March 27, 1874]. Three other letterheads have hand tinted designs - an animal head [August 9, 1872], a ship [May 8, 1874], and boys on a ship's mast [May 13, 1874]. Two letterheads have landscape lithographs by Henry Besley - \"St. Michael's Mount from Lower Tremenheere\" [August 20, 1873] , \"Penzance from Guvul\" and \"St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall\" [August 22, 1873]., \\tThe Don Martin Ibarra letters (1855-1872) consist of 86 letters written in Spanish to Charles Brownell. They are mainly from Cuba, but the last several are from Barcelona, Spain. They are warm letters to a good friend and \"compadre,” but also contain figures on the production of sugar from at least two \"ingenios\" or sugar mills near the Cardenas area of Cuba., \\tA small group of 17 letters from the poet Lucy Larcom (1862-1870, n.d.) were written to Henrietta Angell Pierce Brownell [Mrs. Charles Brownell], and cover the years of Larcom's decision to stop teaching school and to concentrate her energy on her own writing. Her September 19, 1868, letter mentions proofreading a volume for publication, \"my cricket-chirpings of verse.”, \\tEight letters from Henrietta S. Dana (1861-1863) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Henrietta A. Pierce [Brownell] mention Mrs. Dana helping her famous Yale professor husband by taking dictation from him for his most recent book, Manuel of Geology [April 7, 1862]. Her letters also describe the death of two of their children from diphtheria, and her safely nursing one other child through it [December 21, 1861]., Twenty-five letters from Esther Pierce to her divorced and remarried mother, Henrietta Brownell, were written from 1875-1877, when Esther was 14-16 years old and living with her father, Dr. George Pierce, in Providence. Several years earlier, she had been living with her mother and her step-father, Charles Brownell, and had accompanied them on their trip to Europe. Her nickname was \"Kit,” and she is frequently mentioned in her mother's letters. The letters from Esther [Kit] tell of a trip to Canada, local people and visits, and her new clothes, sometimes with accompanying pen and ink drawings. Two letters include swatches of fabric [February 6, 1876, and April 23, 1876]. , More correspondence to and from the Brownells can be found in the Scrapbook Pages series and the Genealogical Notes and Copies series., Beginning in the 1880s, the correspondence focuses more on Annie May Angell, who would marry Ernest Henry Brownell in 1891, and her family. Virginia McLain (1867-1953), who lived in the Bahamas as the daughter of the United States Consul Thomas J. McClain, was a frequent correspondent into the 1890s. One letter dated October 11, 1887, includes a carte-de-visite of Virginia. Other letters in the 1880s relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell's efforts to publish his brother Henry Howard Brownell's poetry. Several letters from 1882 and 1883 relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell, his work on the Charter Oak, and his paintings. One letter by Oliver Wendell Holmes, dated February 11, 1883, indicates one of Charles' paintings was displayed in his library., Correspondence from the 1890s-1910s centers around Annie May and Ernest Brownell, as well as their family circle and acquaintances. Letters written by Bertha Angell to Lewis Kalloch are also well represented in this period. Ernest's letters provide details about May and Ernest's children and marriage, as well as Ernest's work as a Civil Engineer in the United States Navy. Many of his early letters are addressed from the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Navy Yard. Ernest was also stationed in the Philippines and Bremerton, Washington., Around 1905 Ernest Brownell became involved with the Brownell Building in Providence, Rhode Island, which the brothers inherited, and in the following years corresponded with his brothers Carl and Edward about various matters relating to family properties. Several letters from 1912 refer to a large fire at the Brownell Building., Two items from August 1915 were sent to the family of John K. Rathbone relating to the Galveston Hurricane., Correspondence between Dorothea DeWolf Brownell and Clifford Kyler Rathbone begins around 1918. Clifford Rathbone's letters also detail his career in construction. Material from the 1920s relates to family finances and handling of Kalloch estate matters. By the 1930s letters by Dorinda Rathbone begin appearing, as well as more letters from the Rathbone family, including Myrtle Rathbone of Denton, Texas, and Rosalie Rathbone. , Correspondence from 1942-1943 reflects Clifford Rathbone's unsuccessful efforts to join the military, and Henry B. Rathbone's preparation for the U.S. Naval Academy entrance exams. Following Clifford Rathbone's death in March of 1944, the collection includes many condolence letters. The bulk of the correspondence post-1945 is written to Dorinda Rathbone., The Bundled Correspondence Sub-series is comprised of letters arranged by later descendants of the family. The first bundle of seven letters spans from December 20, 1820, to January 29, 1825, relating to Pardon and Lucia Brownell's inheritance from the estate of Lucia's father Charles DeWolf. It includes notes by Dorothea DeWolf Brownell Rathbone. The second bundle includes 16 letters written to Pardon Brownell enclosed in Florence Brownell's January 19, 1931, letter to Dorothea Rathbone, spanning from March 1825 to December 1835 and primarily concern affairs with a DeWolf family property.

       "17  The Brownell family papers contain correspondence, diaries, documents, writings, illustrations, and other materials documenting the family's experiences from the 1820s into the 1960s., The Correspondence Series includes letters written to and by the Brownell family, primarily in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Louisiana, New York City, Cuba, and France between 1823 and 1969, with the bulk dating from the 1850s to 1940s. , Approximately 296 letters are letters to Charles Brownell and his wife Henrietta [Nettie] from Charles' mother, Lucia [Mummy], and his three brothers, Edward [Ned], Henry, and Clarence, often written with notes added and sent on as a \"round robin\" correspondence which ended with Charles. , \\tThe collection contains over 100 letters written by Ned Brownell, with additional notes in other family members' letters. His earliest letters start when he is finishing medical school in New Orleans and continue with his move to rural Louisiana, near Alexandria and Plaisance. These are high-spirited letters with humorous pen and ink drawings of his adventures chasing wild horses (January 29, 1855); mishaps while duck and geese hunting at Lake Catahoula (November 12, 1855; November 10, 1856); and futile attempts to flag down a river steamer (January 29, 1855). But his letters also deal with the problems involved in setting up a medical practice at the same time he, a Northerner, is trying his hand at cotton cultivation. He married a southern woman of French descent whose father  was a slave owner (19 slaves in 1850 and 30 in 1860). Ned describes bringing up his bilingual children in a culture very different from his own. The marriage s was troubled, and by 1858, he sold out his cotton interests and was considering his brother Clarence's offer to take over Clarence's practice in East Hartford, Connecticut. He moved to Cloutierville, Louisiana, for a while. Two letters of introduction written in 1864 (April 4 and April 25) refer to his allegiance to the Union. By June of 1866, he was involved in legal separation hearings and working with his brothers on a testimony about his wife's \"violent scenes and words.” Both during his practice in Louisiana and later in Rhode Island, his letters describe his patients and treatments (cotton gin accident resulting in amputation of an enslaved person's arm - October 26, 1857; treating yellow fever and typhoid - October 14, 1853 and January 12, 1855). He also suggests treatments for family members with diphtheria (n.d. November 8), excessive menstrual bleeding (December 17, 1866), prolapsed uterus after childbirth (February 8, [1867]), and a prescription for a cholera prevention pill (n.d. September 27). He made a trip to Florida with his dying brother Henry in 1871-1872, in the hopes that the warmer climate might make Henry feel more comfortable., \\tOnly a handful of letters and notes are from Clarence Brownell. Seven of these are affectionate letters to his friend Henrietta Angell [Pierce] [Brownell], before and during her first unhappy marriage. The rest of his letters are to his family and include descriptions of his 1861 visit to Ned and family in Cloutierville, his excitement and satisfaction in building a boat in his workshop, and playing chess by mail with brother Charles. Another letter describes his travels in Egypt. He went by horseback from Alexandria to Cairo, 130 miles across the Delta. A map he drew while with the Pethernick Expedition on the White Nile was sent home posthumously ([May 12], 1862). On it he notes their location by date and the location of certain flora and fauna., \\tOver 100 letters and notes are from Lucia D. Brownell (\"Mummy\"), most of them dealing with local affairs, real estate arrangements, and concerns for her sons' health. Several of these letters mention mediums and the spirit world. After the death of her son Clarence in Egypt, Lucia, Ned, and Henry become interested in reports of mediums and \"spiritual pictures.” One item is a copy of a letter that a medium claimed was dictated to him by Clarence's ghost. Ned describes watching a medium who claimed to see \"words in fiery letters in the illuminated smoke of my cigar when I puffed\" [13 May]. Lucia made several visits to a medium (November- December 1862), ending when the medium was proved a fake., \\tCorrespondence with Henry H. Brownell is well represented. The letters mostly come from Hartford, Connecticut, but letters from Bristol, Rhode Island, are also included. He describes visiting Ned and his family in Louisiana in the 1850s, and accompanying Ned on three of his annual duck and geese hunting expeditions to Lake Catahoula. He seems to have acted as agent for the sale of his brother Charles' paintings when Charles was away in Cuba or Europe - \"two little Charter Oaks for $20.\" [n.d. December 26]. Other letters deal with business matters concerning an inheritance from his grandfather De Wolf involving real estate that he and Charles shared, but unequally. These letters contain little mention of Henry's own writing of poetry and the publication of his books. Two copies of letters to Henry written by Oliver Wendell Holmes praising his work are included [January 13 and February 6, 1865]. A typed copy of a letter from Ernest H. Brownell, dated April 6, 1935, lists letters written by Holmes to Henry H. Brownell. Correspondence to Charles DeWolf Brownell represent his work to honor and publish his brother's writings after his death [late 1880s]., \\tAnother part of the Brownell Papers consists of three batches of letters from abroad - the Procter Wright letters from Europe, the Charles and Nettie Brownell letters from Europe, and the Don Martin Ibarra letters from Cuba and Spain. Procter Wright wrote 25 letters (1876-1884) to Mrs. Charles Brownell (Nettie) from Italy, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. He gives good descriptions of his walking and climbing tours as well as his visits to various cities. A few letters discuss religion, including matters of purgatory [April 28, 1880] and creation or Darwinisn [August 18, 1883]. Wright also mentions the death of the artist Jean Louis Hamon, and the auction of his things [July 26, 1876, December 28, 1876]. He reminds Henrietta how much he treasures Charles' painting of \"Witches' Cork Tree\" that the Brownell's had given him some years earlier [April 9, 1883]., \\tThe twenty letters written by Charles and Nettie in Europe (1872-1874) to family at home talk of their travels, their children, and anything unusual that catches their eye - \"Creche\" day care system in France [August 20, 1873] or a trip to the \"Crystal Palace\" in London [August 29, 1873]. Charles made small pen and ink drawings on three of the letters - a bird on a branch [July 28, 1872], an Egyptian \"cartouche\" [May 6, 1873], and a dental molar [March 27, 1874]. Three other letterheads have hand tinted designs - an animal head [August 9, 1872], a ship [May 8, 1874], and boys on a ship's mast [May 13, 1874]. Two letterheads have landscape lithographs by Henry Besley - \"St. Michael's Mount from Lower Tremenheere\" [August 20, 1873] , \"Penzance from Guvul\" and \"St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall\" [August 22, 1873]., \\tThe Don Martin Ibarra letters (1855-1872) consist of 86 letters written in Spanish to Charles Brownell. They are mainly from Cuba, but the last several are from Barcelona, Spain. They are warm letters to a good friend and \"compadre,” but also contain figures on the production of sugar from at least two \"ingenios\" or sugar mills near the Cardenas area of Cuba., \\tA small group of 17 letters from the poet Lucy Larcom (1862-1870, n.d.) were written to Henrietta Angell Pierce Brownell [Mrs. Charles Brownell], and cover the years of Larcom's decision to stop teaching school and to concentrate her energy on her own writing. Her September 19, 1868, letter mentions proofreading a volume for publication, \"my cricket-chirpings of verse.”, \\tEight letters from Henrietta S. Dana (1861-1863) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Henrietta A. Pierce [Brownell] mention Mrs. Dana helping her famous Yale professor husband by taking dictation from him for his most recent book, Manuel of Geology [April 7, 1862]. Her letters also describe the death of two of their children from diphtheria, and her safely nursing one other child through it [December 21, 1861]., Twenty-five letters from Esther Pierce to her divorced and remarried mother, Henrietta Brownell, were written from 1875-1877, when Esther was 14-16 years old and living with her father, Dr. George Pierce, in Providence. Several years earlier, she had been living with her mother and her step-father, Charles Brownell, and had accompanied them on their trip to Europe. Her nickname was \"Kit,” and she is frequently mentioned in her mother's letters. The letters from Esther [Kit] tell of a trip to Canada, local people and visits, and her new clothes, sometimes with accompanying pen and ink drawings. Two letters include swatches of fabric [February 6, 1876, and April 23, 1876]. , More correspondence to and from the Brownells can be found in the Scrapbook Pages series and the Genealogical Notes and Copies series., Beginning in the 1880s, the correspondence focuses more on Annie May Angell, who would marry Ernest Henry Brownell in 1891, and her family.

One letter dated October 11, 1887, includes a carte-de-visite of Virginia. Other letters in the 1880s relate to Charles DeWolf Brownell's efforts to publish his brother Henry Howard Brownell's poetry.

One letter by Oliver Wendell Holmes, dated February 11, 1883, indicates one of Charles' paintings was displayed in his library., Correspondence from the 1890s-1910s centers around Annie May and Ernest Brownell, as well as their family circle and acquaintances. Letters written by Bertha Angell to Lewis Kalloch are also well represented in this period. Ernest's letters provide details about May and Ernest's children and marriage, as well as Ernest's work as a Civil Engineer in the United States Navy. Many of his early letters are addressed from the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Navy Yard. Ernest was also stationed in the Philippines and Bremerton, Washington., Around 1905 Ernest Brownell became involved with the Brownell Building in Providence, Rhode Island, which the brothers inherited, and in the following years corresponded with his brothers Carl and Edward about various matters relating to family properties.

       "18  Lucia Emilia DeWolf (1795-1884) was born in Bristol, Rhode Island, the daughter of Charles DeWolf and Elizabeth Rogerson. She married Pardon Brownell (1788-1846) in 1815, and had six children by him before he died in 1846. Her first four children were born in Providence, Rhode Island, and the last two in East Hartford, Connecticut. Two of her children died before the age of 16: Francis D. Brownell, her first born (1817-1833), and Emilia D. Brownell, her only daughter (1823-1838). Her surviving children were Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), Edward Rogerson Brownell (1825-1889), and Clarence Melville Brownell (1828-1862). After her husband's death, she moved back and forth between Bristol, Rhode Island, and East Hartford, Connecticut. The 1860 Census lists her as owing $51,500 of real estate. Her son Edward, a physician, made his home with her after his divorce, c.1864., Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), the second child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, studied law, and became a practicing lawyer in Connecticut for a short time, before deciding to concentrate on writing. He published his first volume, Poems, in 1847, but it was as a Civil War poet that he was best known. At his own request, he was allowed to accompany Admiral Farragut into battle, so that he could write about it firsthand. He was made an ensign and acted as Admiral Farragut's secretary. After the Civil War he accompanied Farragut on a European tour. His book, Lyrics of a Day, or Newspaper Poetry, by a Volunteer in Service, was well reviewed by Oliver Wendell Holmes in an article entitled \"Our Battle Laureate\" in the May 1865 issue of the Atlantic Monthly. Holmes continued to encourage his writing efforts. Henry H. Brownell published War Lyrics and Other Poems in 1866, and is one of the people attributed with writing the lyrics for the song \"John Brown's Body.\" He also wrote two popular histories for subscription publishers: The People's Book of Ancient and Modern History in 1851, and The Discoverers, Pioneers, and Settlers of North and South America in 1853. He developed cancer of the face, and underwent surgery in Boston, resulting in the removal of only part of the tumor. His last few years were painful. He made a trip to Florida with his brother Ned (Edward) in 1871-72 where they felt the warmer climate might make Henry more comfortable. At his death, the poet Thomas Bailey Aldrich eulogized him in a short poem, (“Henry Howard Brownell,” Atlantic Monthly, May 1873)., Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), the third child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a landscape artist. He spent seven consecutive winters in Cuba (1854-1861), traveled extensively throughout Europe (1871-1877), to Egypt in 1877, the Caribbean in 1888, and Jamaica in 1894, as well as to various parts of the U.S. Although trained as a lawyer, like his brother Henry, he soon decided against a law career. He took various jobs in Liberty, Virginia, from 1848-1849, and Alexandria, Louisiana, in 1850, and authored a book, The Indian Races of America in 1850, before deciding to concentrate on his painting. He studied with Julius Busch and Joseph Ropes in Hartford. His first works were exhibited at the Hartford Agricultural Society County fair in 1855, and he set up a studio in Hartford in 1857 -1858. In 1860, he moved to New York City and submitted work for sale at the National Academy of Design there in 1861-1862. He married Henrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) after her divorce from Dr. George A. Pierce in 1865 (see biography of Henrietta Knowlton Angell below). When not traveling abroad, they lived in Bristol, Rhode Island, with their four sons: Carl DeWolf Brownell born 1866, Ernest Henry Brownell born 1867, G. Edward Ibarra Brownell born 1870, and Roger Williams Brownell born 1876. His step daughter, Esther Pierce (b. 1860), sometimes lived with the family. His most well-known painting is \"The Connecticut Charter Oak.”, \\tEdward Rogerson Brownell [Ned] (1825-1889), the fifth child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a physician like his father. He attended medical school in New Orleans, and was made a visiting physician at the Charity Hospital there while still a student. He took his diploma exam in 1850, and moved to rural Plaisance, Louisiana, where he married Pamela Laysard (b. in 1838, daughter of Malafret Laysard) in 1853. Edward tried to combine his medical practice in rural Louisiana with raising cotton, but had little success in the cotton business. He and Pamela had six children before they became embroiled in a bitter separation. The oldest child, Francis (b. 1854), came back East with his father prior to 1866, and in the 1880 Census was living with a great aunt in Hartford, Connecticut. The other four living children (Lucia b. 1857, Arthur b. 1859, Clarence b. 1860, and Charles b. 1862) stayed in Louisiana with their mother. The 1910 Census lists Pamela L. Brownell as living in Rapides County, Louisiana, at age 70, with only one of her six children still alive. Edward [Ned] spent the years after his marital separation living with his mother in Bristol, Rhode Island, and is listed in the 1880 Census as an \"alopathic physician\"., \\tClarence Melville Brownell, the youngest child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was born May 2, 1828, in East Harford, Connecticut, and died in May 1862, on the White Nile River in Central Africa [Lat. 8 N.] at the age of 34. He never married. Despite being trained as a physician and having built up a thriving medical practice in East Hartford (1853-1859), he had a strong desire to travel to remote areas. In November 1859, he left for Callao, Peru, and made a trip down the Amazon. In 1860, he traveled to St. Thomas and Cuba. In 1861 he visited his brother Ned in rural Cloutierville, Louisiana, and then left for Alexandria, Egypt, via Marseille, expecting to be gone two years. In late October a letter was forwarded to him in Marseille offering him a captaincy in a Connecticut Regiment, which he had been most eager to have. But, because he had already begun his trip to Egypt, he decided to go on. In Khartoum he met John Pethernick and joined his expedition to the source of the White Nile, agreeing to make botanical collections for them. Brownell kept a diary from January 1, 1862, to May 13, 1862 [typescript at the University of Durham, England], describing his travels, as well as the flora and fauna he encountered. The diary ended about a week before his death when he became too ill to write. John Pethernick's wife wrote an account of his death in Travels in Central Africa, published in 1869 in London., \\tHenrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) was the daughter of Henry Angell and Rebecca Knowlton of Rhode Island. She married Dr. George A. Pierce in February 1859. They had two children, Esther H. Pierce (b. 1860) and Henry A. Pierce (1863-1867), before divorcing. In 1865, Henrietta married the artist Charles DeWolf Brownell, by whom she had four sons: Carl D. Brownell, b. 1866; Ernest Henry Brownell, b. 1867; G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell, b.1870; and Roger Williams Brownell, b. 1876. She and the children accompanied Charles to Europe in the 1870s. At some point she converted to Catholicism, and published two long stories in serial form in the journal Catholic World. One was called Donna Quixote (1882) and the other Out of the West (1883). She also wrote God's Way, Man's Way - A History of Bristol, Rhode Island, and submitted articles to the Phoenix. It was at her request and with her financial support that four Sisters of Mercy from Providence, Rhode Island, were sent across to Newfoundland's west coast to found the first Sisters of Mercy house there in 1893., Henritetta Knowlton Angell and Charles DeWolf Brownell's son Ernest Henry Brownell was born in 1867. He graduated from Brown University in 1888 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890. He was an instructor in civil engineering at Brown University in the 1890s. Beginning in 1902, he served as an officer in the United States Navy Civil Engineer Corps, holding positions at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; New York, New York; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Florida; and Washington, D.C. In 1891 he married Annie May Angell (1866-1958). Together they had four children: John Angell Brownell (1892-1977), Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982), Margaret Knowlton Brownell (1895-1977), and Thomas Church Brownell (1898-1953). He died in 1945 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island., Annie May Angell Brownell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1866 to John Arnold Angell (1837-1877) and Annie Wardwell Usher Angell (1840-1898). Her siblings included Bertha Angell (1868-1928), John Wardwell Angell (1870-1927), and Elsie Angell (1875-1877). Her paternal grandparents were John Angell (b. 1794) and Nancy Arnold Angell (1798-1876). From 1910 to 1940, she is listed in the United States Federal Censuses as a patient in the Butler Hospital for the Insane. She died in 1958 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island., Bertha Angell, born in 1868, was Annie May Angell Brownell's sister. In 1902 she married Lewis Howe Kalloch (b. 1867), a dentist, and in 1904 she gave birth to Lewis Howe Kalloch, Jr. They appear to have been involved in business with Ernest and Annie May Brownell. She died in 1928., Annie May Angell Brownell and Ernest Henry Brownell's daughter Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982) graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. She married Clifford Kyler Rathbone (1893-1944) in 1923. Clifford's parents were John K. Rathbone and Myrtle Petty Rathbone of Denton, Texas. Clifford Rathbone worked in construction, listed as a contractor in the 1930 United States Federal Census and an architectural engineer in 1940. He had at least one sibling, Rosalie Rathbone (1891-1976), who married William A. Craft (1894-1963) in 1950. Both Rosalie and William Craft taught at Iowa State. , Together Dorothea and Clifford Rathbone had two children, Dorinda Rathbone (1924-2009) and Henry Brownell Rathbone (1925-1951). Dorinda Rathbone attended the University of Washington and married Carlos Dew, Jr., in 1946. Henry Rathbone graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. He was killed during the Korean War while serving in the United States Navy., Other figures in the collection are noted below. , \\tProcer Wright was probably an Englishman.  He seems to have met Charles and Henrietta Brownell in San Raphael, France, in 1876.  He and Henrietta Brownell became friends and corresponded between 1876 and 1884, when Wright was traveling through Europe. , \\tDon Manuel Ibarra was a Spaniard married to a Cuban woman.  He worked at the San Martin sugar refinery (\"ingenio\") near Cardenas, Cuba.  He was probably the refinery manager, but could have been a partial owner.  He worked in Cuba from 1855-1870, returning to Barcelona, Spain, by 1871, perhaps because of the unrest caused by the Cuban \"Ten-Year War\" which started in October of 1868 and involved bloody clashes between Cuban independence seekers and Spanish troops.  Ibarra met Charles Brownell in Cuba. They became such close friends that Brownell named his third son born in 1870, after Ibarra (G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell)., \\tLucy Larcom (1824-1893) was a poet, author and editor.  She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Larcom and Lois Barrett.  After her father's death, the family moved to Lowell, where her mother kept a boarding house, and Lucy worked in the mills for ten years.  Through a literary club at the mills, she met John G. Whittier who encouraged her to write.  She accompanied a married sister to Illinois where she taught school for three years before attending Monticello Female Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, for three years.  She returned to Beverly, Massachusetts, and taught for six years at Wheaton Female Seminary, where she met Henrietta Angell [Brownell]. When her health began to fail, she resigned and took a position editing the children's magazine Our Young Folks.  She continued to write and publish her own poetry and prose.  She never married., \\tHenrietta Silliman Dana (1823-1907) was the daughter of Benjamin Silliman, a professor at Yale, and Harriet Trumbell.  In 1844, she married James Dwight Dana who became a renown professor of geology at Yale.  He accompanied the Charles Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific in the early 1840's, and then became Silliman Professor of Natural History and Geology at Yale until several years before he died in 1895.  He wrote classical works on geology and mineralogy.  The Danas had six children, but lost two of them to diphtheria in 1861.  Their son, Edward (b. 1849), also became a professor at Yale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "19  Lucia Emilia DeWolf (1795-1884) was born in Bristol, Rhode Island, the daughter of Charles DeWolf and Elizabeth Rogerson. She married Pardon Brownell (1788-1846) in 1815, and had six children by him before he died in 1846. Her first four children were born in Providence, Rhode Island, and the last two in East Hartford, Connecticut. Two of her children died before the age of 16: Francis D. Brownell, her first born (1817-1833), and Emilia D. Brownell, her only daughter (1823-1838). Her surviving children were Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), Edward Rogerson Brownell (1825-1889), and Clarence Melville Brownell (1828-1862). After her husband's death, she moved back and forth between Bristol, Rhode Island, and East Hartford, Connecticut. The 1860 Census lists her as owing $51,500 of real estate. Her son Edward, a physician, made his home with her after his divorce, c.1864., Henry Howard Brownell (1820-1872), the second child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, studied law, and became a practicing lawyer in Connecticut for a short time, before deciding to concentrate on writing. He published his first volume, Poems, in 1847, but it was as a Civil War poet that he was best known. At his own request, he was allowed to accompany Admiral Farragut into battle, so that he could write about it firsthand. He was made an ensign and acted as Admiral Farragut's secretary. After the Civil War he accompanied Farragut on a European tour. His book, Lyrics of a Day, or Newspaper Poetry, by a Volunteer in Service, was well reviewed by Oliver Wendell Holmes in an article entitled \"Our Battle Laureate\" in the May 1865 issue of the Atlantic Monthly. Holmes continued to encourage his writing efforts. Henry H. Brownell published War Lyrics and Other Poems in 1866, and is one of the people attributed with writing the lyrics for the song \"John Brown's Body.\" He also wrote two popular histories for subscription publishers: The People's Book of Ancient and Modern History in 1851, and The Discoverers, Pioneers, and Settlers of North and South America in 1853. He developed cancer of the face, and underwent surgery in Boston, resulting in the removal of only part of the tumor. His last few years were painful. He made a trip to Florida with his brother Ned (Edward) in 1871-72 where they felt the warmer climate might make Henry more comfortable. At his death, the poet Thomas Bailey Aldrich eulogized him in a short poem, (“Henry Howard Brownell,” Atlantic Monthly, May 1873)., Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822-1909), the third child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a landscape artist. He spent seven consecutive winters in Cuba (1854-1861), traveled extensively throughout Europe (1871-1877), to Egypt in 1877, the Caribbean in 1888, and Jamaica in 1894, as well as to various parts of the U.S. Although trained as a lawyer, like his brother Henry, he soon decided against a law career. He took various jobs in Liberty, Virginia, from 1848-1849, and Alexandria, Louisiana, in 1850, and authored a book, The Indian Races of America in 1850, before deciding to concentrate on his painting. He studied with Julius Busch and Joseph Ropes in Hartford. His first works were exhibited at the Hartford Agricultural Society County fair in 1855, and he set up a studio in Hartford in 1857 -1858. In 1860, he moved to New York City and submitted work for sale at the National Academy of Design there in 1861-1862. He married Henrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) after her divorce from Dr. George A. Pierce in 1865 (see biography of Henrietta Knowlton Angell below). When not traveling abroad, they lived in Bristol, Rhode Island, with their four sons: Carl DeWolf Brownell born 1866, Ernest Henry Brownell born 1867, G. Edward Ibarra Brownell born 1870, and Roger Williams Brownell born 1876. His step daughter, Esther Pierce (b. 1860), sometimes lived with the family. His most well-known painting is \"The Connecticut Charter Oak.”, \\tEdward Rogerson Brownell [Ned] (1825-1889), the fifth child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was a physician like his father. He attended medical school in New Orleans, and was made a visiting physician at the Charity Hospital there while still a student. He took his diploma exam in 1850, and moved to rural Plaisance, Louisiana, where he married Pamela Laysard (b. in 1838, daughter of Malafret Laysard) in 1853. Edward tried to combine his medical practice in rural Louisiana with raising cotton, but had little success in the cotton business. He and Pamela had six children before they became embroiled in a bitter separation. The oldest child, Francis (b. 1854), came back East with his father prior to 1866, and in the 1880 Census was living with a great aunt in Hartford, Connecticut. The other four living children (Lucia b. 1857, Arthur b. 1859, Clarence b. 1860, and Charles b. 1862) stayed in Louisiana with their mother. The 1910 Census lists Pamela L. Brownell as living in Rapides County, Louisiana, at age 70, with only one of her six children still alive. Edward [Ned] spent the years after his marital separation living with his mother in Bristol, Rhode Island, and is listed in the 1880 Census as an \"alopathic physician\"., \\tClarence Melville Brownell, the youngest child of Lucia and Pardon Brownell, was born May 2, 1828, in East Harford, Connecticut, and died in May 1862, on the White Nile River in Central Africa [Lat. 8 N.] at the age of 34. He never married. Despite being trained as a physician and having built up a thriving medical practice in East Hartford (1853-1859), he had a strong desire to travel to remote areas. In November 1859, he left for Callao, Peru, and made a trip down the Amazon. In 1860, he traveled to St. Thomas and Cuba. In 1861 he visited his brother Ned in rural Cloutierville, Louisiana, and then left for Alexandria, Egypt, via Marseille, expecting to be gone two years. In late October a letter was forwarded to him in Marseille offering him a captaincy in a Connecticut Regiment, which he had been most eager to have. But, because he had already begun his trip to Egypt, he decided to go on. In Khartoum he met John Pethernick and joined his expedition to the source of the White Nile, agreeing to make botanical collections for them. Brownell kept a diary from January 1, 1862, to May 13, 1862 [typescript at the University of Durham, England], describing his travels, as well as the flora and fauna he encountered. The diary ended about a week before his death when he became too ill to write. John Pethernick's wife wrote an account of his death in Travels in Central Africa, published in 1869 in London., \\tHenrietta Knowlton Angell (1837-1897) was the daughter of Henry Angell and Rebecca Knowlton of Rhode Island. She married Dr. George A. Pierce in February 1859. They had two children, Esther H. Pierce (b. 1860) and Henry A. Pierce (1863-1867), before divorcing. In 1865, Henrietta married the artist Charles DeWolf Brownell, by whom she had four sons: Carl D. Brownell, b. 1866; Ernest Henry Brownell, b. 1867; G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell, b.1870; and Roger Williams Brownell, b. 1876. She and the children accompanied Charles to Europe in the 1870s. At some point she converted to Catholicism, and published two long stories in serial form in the journal Catholic World. One was called Donna Quixote (1882) and the other Out of the West (1883). She also wrote God's Way, Man's Way - A History of Bristol, Rhode Island, and submitted articles to the Phoenix. It was at her request and with her financial support that four Sisters of Mercy from Providence, Rhode Island, were sent across to Newfoundland's west coast to found the first Sisters of Mercy house there in 1893., Henritetta Knowlton Angell and Charles DeWolf Brownell's son Ernest Henry Brownell was born in 1867. He graduated from Brown University in 1888 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890. He was an instructor in civil engineering at Brown University in the 1890s. Beginning in 1902, he served as an officer in the United States Navy Civil Engineer Corps, holding positions at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; New York, New York; Cavite, Philippines; Bremerton, Washington; Florida; and Washington, D.C. In 1891 he married Annie May Angell (1866-1958). Together they had four children: John Angell Brownell (1892-1977), Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982), Margaret Knowlton Brownell (1895-1977), and Thomas Church Brownell (1898-1953). He died in 1945 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island., Annie May Angell Brownell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1866 to John Arnold Angell (1837-1877) and Annie Wardwell Usher Angell (1840-1898). Her siblings included Bertha Angell (1868-1928), John Wardwell Angell (1870-1927), and Elsie Angell (1875-1877). Her paternal grandparents were John Angell (b. 1794) and Nancy Arnold Angell (1798-1876). From 1910 to 1940, she is listed in the United States Federal Censuses as a patient in the Butler Hospital for the Insane. She died in 1958 and is buried in Bristol, Rhode Island., Bertha Angell, born in 1868, was Annie May Angell Brownell's sister. In 1902 she married Lewis Howe Kalloch (b. 1867), a dentist, and in 1904 she gave birth to Lewis Howe Kalloch, Jr. They appear to have been involved in business with Ernest and Annie May Brownell. She died in 1928., Annie May Angell Brownell and Ernest Henry Brownell's daughter Dorothea DeWolf Brownell (1893-1982) graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. She married Clifford Kyler Rathbone (1893-1944) in 1923. Clifford's parents were John K. Rathbone and Myrtle Petty Rathbone of Denton, Texas. Clifford Rathbone worked in construction, listed as a contractor in the 1930 United States Federal Census and an architectural engineer in 1940. He had at least one sibling, Rosalie Rathbone (1891-1976), who married William A. Craft (1894-1963) in 1950. Both Rosalie and William Craft taught at Iowa State. , Together Dorothea and Clifford Rathbone had two children, Dorinda Rathbone (1924-2009) and Henry Brownell Rathbone (1925-1951). Dorinda Rathbone attended the University of Washington and married Carlos Dew, Jr., in 1946. Henry Rathbone graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. He was killed during the Korean War while serving in the United States Navy., Other figures in the collection are noted below. , \\tProcer Wright was probably an Englishman.  He seems to have met Charles and Henrietta Brownell in San Raphael, France, in 1876.  He and Henrietta Brownell became friends and corresponded between 1876 and 1884, when Wright was traveling through Europe. , \\tDon Manuel Ibarra was a Spaniard married to a Cuban woman.  He worked at the San Martin sugar refinery (\"ingenio\") near Cardenas, Cuba.  He was probably the refinery manager, but could have been a partial owner.  He worked in Cuba from 1855-1870, returning to Barcelona, Spain, by 1871, perhaps because of the unrest caused by the Cuban \"Ten-Year War\" which started in October of 1868 and involved bloody clashes between Cuban independence seekers and Spanish troops.  Ibarra met Charles Brownell in Cuba. They became such close friends that Brownell named his third son born in 1870, after Ibarra (G. Edward Don Manuel Ibarra D. Brownell)., \\tLucy Larcom (1824-1893) was a poet, author and editor.  She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Larcom and Lois Barrett.  After her father's death, the family moved to Lowell, where her mother kept a boarding house, and Lucy worked in the mills for ten years.  Through a literary club at the mills, she met John G. Whittier who encouraged her to write.  She accompanied a married sister to Illinois where she taught school for three years before attending Monticello Female Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, for three years.  She returned to Beverly, Massachusetts, and taught for six years at Wheaton Female Seminary, where she met Henrietta Angell [Brownell]. When her health began to fail, she resigned and took a position editing the children's magazine Our Young Folks.  She continued to write and publish her own poetry and prose.  She never married., \\tHenrietta Silliman Dana (1823-1907) was the daughter of Benjamin Silliman, a professor at Yale, and Harriet Trumbell.  In 1844, she married James Dwight Dana who became a renown professor of geology at Yale.  He accompanied the Charles Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific in the early 1840's, and then became Silliman Professor of Natural History and Geology at Yale until several years before he died in 1895.  He wrote classical works on geology and mineralogy.  The Danas had six children, but lost two of them to diphtheria in 1861.  Their son, Edward (b. 1849), also became a professor at Yale.

       "      <td>Thomas Emmett Hayden (Tom Hayden) was born on December 11, 1939 in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Dondero High School in 1956 and went onto attend the University of Michigan, where he served as the editor of the Michigan Daily. While a student at the University of Michigan, Hayden became one of the founders of the leftist student organization, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), playing an active role in drafting the group's manifesto called the Port Huron Statement, which sought to create a \"radically new democratic political movement\" in the United States that rejected hierarchy and bureaucracy. He served as President of SDS from 1962-1963. In 1968, Hayden along with seven other demonstrators, referred to as the \"Chicago Eight\" had integral parts in orchestrating protests outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois and were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot that were later dropped on appeal. Hayden is also known for making several trips to North Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War, especially the 1972 trip he made with his future wife, Jane Fonda, whom he married the following year. The couple's son Troy was born on July 7, 1973. Haden and Fonda were instrumental in the production of the documentary, Introduction to the Enemy, which chronicled their travels through North and South Vietnam in the spring of 1974. During this period, Hayden also spearheaded the Indochina Peace Campaign that mobilized dissent against the Vietnam War and demanded unconditional amnesty for draft dodgers. Fonda turned the moniker into the name of her film company that produced movies like F.T.A. and Introduction to the Enemy.,  Hayden entered the political arena in 1976 when he ran for the primary to be a U.S. Senator from California. Despite conducting a spirited campaign, Hayden came in second. He and Fonda then initiated the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which promoted solar energy, environmental protection, and renter rights' policies as well as candidates for local offices. Hayden represented the 44th district in the California State Assembly from 1982 to 1990. He won a seat in the California State Senate in 1992. Though he lost in the Democratic primary for the California gubernatorial race in 1994, Hayden was able to keep his seat in the Senate in the 1996 election. In 1997, he decided to run for mayor of Los Angeles, which he ultimately lost. Hayden thought about entering the race in 2000 to represent the 42nd district in the California State Assembly but reconsidered to campaign to be part of the Los Angeles City Council,which was a battle he ended up losing. He did, however, become the state's first energy official. Throughout his political career, Hayden has strove to make an impact. He has been a champion of many issues from disaster assistance, to safe driving, to Holocaust reparations, to tobacco regulation, to HIV/AIDS programs. Hayden was on the forefront of proposing educational and environmental initiatives, which were two main focuses of his as a legislator. He also contended with matters that emerged while in office like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority strikes that occurred in the 1990s. While Hayden was primarily concerned with problems facing the Californian population, he also showed an interest in global events, particularly in the Israel, Ireland, and El Salvador conflicts.,  In addition to his roles as an activist and politician, Hayden has also written profusely. Some of his books include: Vietnam: The Struggle for Peace, 1972-1973 (1973), The American Future: New Visions beyond Old Frontiers (1980) , Reunion: A Memoir (1988), The Lost Gospel of Earth: A Call for Renewing Nature, Spirit and Politics (1996), Irish Hunger (1997), and Irish on the Inside: A Search of the Soul of Irish America (2001), and Street Wars: Gangs and the Future of Violence (2004). He has also written numerous articles about a host of topics that range from baseball to the Iraq War.,  Another capacity in which Hayen has served has been as an instructor. He has taught numerous courses on social movements at Pitzer College, Scripps College, Occidental College, Harvard University's Institute for Politics, and University of California Los Angeles.,  In recognition for his contributions to society at large, Hayden has been awarded numerous honors such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Martin Luther King Legacy Association President's Award, Irish American Unity Conference Sean MacBride Award in 1997, and The State Senate Peace Keepers Award in 1998.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Herbert Welsh (1851-1941) was a political reformer and indigenous peoples rights' activist in United States. Welsh was born in Pennsylvania, the youngest of 8 children. Before becoming involved in politics, Welsh spent his early life immersed in the study of art with the intention of working as an artist. After a time, he became involved in humanitarian causes and rights reform. In 1882, he founded the Indian Rights Association, which was a group of white Pennsylvanians working on behalf of American indigenous peoples. In 1890, he became involved in the fight against political corruption by joining the Civil Service Reform Association of Pennsylvania as well as the National Civil Service Reform League. During his career, he also authored a number of publications discussing the rights of Native Americans with a particular majority concerning the Great Sioux Nation. In addition to addressing political corruption and human rights in America, Welsh also had a keen interest in anti-imperialism. He vocally disavowed the United States' involvement in the Spanish American War as well as the country's involvement in the Philippines.</td>\n",

It  contains very little related to Bartlett's work in botany (for more on Bartlett's career, see the see the Harley Harris Bartlett Papers: 1909-1960 at the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "5  Thomas Emmett Hayden (Tom Hayden) was born on December 11, 1939 in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Dondero High School in 1956 and went onto attend the University of Michigan, where he served as the editor of the Michigan Daily. While a student at the University of Michigan, Hayden became one of the founders of the leftist student organization, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), playing an active role in drafting the group's manifesto called the Port Huron Statement, which sought to create a \"radically new democratic political movement\" in the United States that rejected hierarchy and bureaucracy. He served as President of SDS from 1962-1963. In 1968, Hayden along with seven other demonstrators, referred to as the \"Chicago Eight\" had integral parts in orchestrating protests outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois and were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot that were later dropped on appeal. Hayden is also known for making several trips to North Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War, especially the 1972 trip he made with his future wife, Jane Fonda, whom he married the following year. The couple's son Troy was born on July 7, 1973. Haden and Fonda were instrumental in the production of the documentary, Introduction to the Enemy, which chronicled their travels through North and South Vietnam in the spring of 1974. During this period, Hayden also spearheaded the Indochina Peace Campaign that mobilized dissent against the Vietnam War and demanded unconditional amnesty for draft dodgers. Fonda turned the moniker into the name of her film company that produced movies like F.T.A. and Introduction to the Enemy.,  Hayden entered the political arena in 1976 when he ran for the primary to be a U.S. Senator from California. Despite conducting a spirited campaign, Hayden came in second. He and Fonda then initiated the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which promoted solar energy, environmental protection, and renter rights' policies as well as candidates for local offices. Hayden represented the 44th district in the California State Assembly from 1982 to 1990. He won a seat in the California State Senate in 1992. Though he lost in the Democratic primary for the California gubernatorial race in 1994, Hayden was able to keep his seat in the Senate in the 1996 election. In 1997, he decided to run for mayor of Los Angeles, which he ultimately lost. Hayden thought about entering the race in 2000 to represent the 42nd district in the California State Assembly but reconsidered to campaign to be part of the Los Angeles City Council,which was a battle he ended up losing. He did, however, become the state's first energy official. Throughout his political career, Hayden has strove to make an impact. He has been a champion of many issues from disaster assistance, to safe driving, to Holocaust reparations, to tobacco regulation, to HIV/AIDS programs. Hayden was on the forefront of proposing educational and environmental initiatives, which were two main focuses of his as a legislator. He also contended with matters that emerged while in office like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority strikes that occurred in the 1990s. While Hayden was primarily concerned with problems facing the Californian population, he also showed an interest in global events, particularly in the Israel, Ireland, and El Salvador conflicts.,  In addition to his roles as an activist and politician, Hayden has also written profusely. Some of his books include: Vietnam: The Struggle for Peace, 1972-1973 (1973), The American Future: New Visions beyond Old Frontiers (1980) , Reunion: A Memoir (1988), The Lost Gospel of Earth: A Call for Renewing Nature, Spirit and Politics (1996), Irish Hunger (1997), and Irish on the Inside: A Search of the Soul of Irish America (2001), and Street Wars: Gangs and the Future of Violence (2004). He has also written numerous articles about a host of topics that range from baseball to the Iraq War.,  Another capacity in which Hayen has served has been as an instructor. He has taught numerous courses on social movements at Pitzer College, Scripps College, Occidental College, Harvard University's Institute for Politics, and University of California Los Angeles.,  In recognition for his contributions to society at large, Hayden has been awarded numerous honors such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Martin Luther King Legacy Association President's Award, Irish American Unity Conference Sean MacBride Award in 1997, and The State Senate Peace Keepers Award in 1998.  \n",
       "6  Herbert Welsh (1851-1941) was a political reformer and indigenous peoples rights' activist in United States. Welsh was born in Pennsylvania, the youngest of 8 children. Before becoming involved in politics, Welsh spent his early life immersed in the study of art with the intention of working as an artist. After a time, he became involved in humanitarian causes and rights reform. In 1882, he founded the Indian Rights Association, which was a group of white Pennsylvanians working on behalf of American indigenous peoples. In 1890, he became involved in the fight against political corruption by joining the Civil Service Reform Association of Pennsylvania as well as the National Civil Service Reform League. During his career, he also authored a number of publications discussing the rights of Native Americans with a particular majority concerning the Great Sioux Nation.
