In 1959 the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&A) had proposed the expansion of ""area studies"" at the University of Michigan. This proposal included the establishment of four ""area centers"": the Center for Chinese Studies, the Center for Russian and Eastern European Studies, the Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies as well as CSSEAS, using the Center for Japanese Studies as a model.

Courses were taken from the curricula of various departments, schools and colleges including Economics, Landscape Design, the Law School, and the College of Engineering. By the mid-1930s, a demand had developed for individuals trained to perform various administrative functions in Michigan. In 1936, the Institute of Social and Public Administration was established as part of the graduate school at the university to address this need. A program was developed to satisfy demands for trained administrators who could work in the fields of public administration, land utilization, and social work. In 1938, the Bureau of Government, a center for research on municipal administration, became part of the University Institute of Public and Social Administration.,  The Regents of the University of Michigan approved a plan for the establishment of the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) on September 28, 1945. A formal announcement of the formation of the new institute was issued in March 1946. The new program had several goals. They included training students in the field of public administration as well as conducting research on matters of public interest such as taxes, employment, etc. Offering services to public officials and legislative bodies was also identified as one of the goals of the program. Finally, the program would cooperate with government offices to offer ""in-service training"" to advanced students, as well as to offer short courses to public employees. Instruction and research in the fields of law, engineering, public health, and economics, among others, were integrated into the program.,  In 1949, the IPA participated in the first of a series of international programs about public policy and administration issues. The IPA was one of six American universities to host Germans who were instructed in American social/political institutions and democratic skills, as well as other subjects. The second international project in which the Institute of Public Administration was involved in the1950s was the establishment of the Institute of Public Administration at the University of the Philippines in 1952. The goal of this project was to train Filipinos for work in public administration and help Philippine government employees improve their effectiveness. The Institute was staffed by professors from the University of Michigan, although over time they were replaced by instructors from the Philippine University. During the 1960s, the Institute worked on another international project entitled the Taiwan Center for Public and Business Administration. The Taiwan Center was a joint effort by the government of the Republic of China, the University of Michigan, and the Agency for International Aid. The Center offered an undergraduate degree in public and business administration, as well as an in-service training program. In addition to the in-service and undergraduate degree programs, the Taiwan Center also developed the Chinese Journal of Administration, held seminars for Taiwan's government officials, and sent faculty from Taiwan to the United States for advanced training.,  In 1968, the Institute of Public Policy Studies (IPPS) was formed. The new program synthesized the offerings of the Institute of Public Administration with courses in economic analysis, quantitative methods, and other subjects. It was one of the first graduate programs in public policy in the United States. The program at the University of Michigan was modeled on an interdisciplinary approach to public policy issues that used the techniques and tools of the social sciences to address social problems. Links with the schools of Law, Business, Natural Resources, and Public Health allowed the program to expand the areas of expertise that were offered. The mission of IPPS was to research public policy issues and train students for careers in public services. It also recognized the absence of a program in which public officials could enhance and renew their skills. A series of policy seminars for public officials was established to address this need. Over the time of its existence, IPPS also played a leading role in the development of an international curriculum in public policy studies.,  In 1995, IPPS was established as an independent school within the University of Michigan and was subsequently designated as the School of Public Policy.,  In 1999, the School of Public Policy was re-named the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy in honor of the 38th President of the United States, Gerald R. Ford, who graduated from the University of Michigan in 1935. Since 2001, the school has offered joint doctoral programs with the departments of economics, political science, and sociology. The school began construction of a new home, Joan and Sanford Weil Hall, in the fall of 2004 and dedicated the building in the fall of 2006.",

The Unit Publications series includes a comprehensive collection of bibliographies such as the Guide to Manuscripts in the Bentley Historical Library published in 1976 and a bibliography of works derived using the holdings in the Bentley Historical Library, 1935-2010, issued as the Bentley celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010. The Bulletin Series is a series of booklets largely written on Michigan or University of Michigan topics using Bentley Library collections and record groups as source material. This series began in 1947 and continues to the present.,  The Unit Publications series contains monographs published by or in conjunction with the Bentley Historical Library. This eclectic subseries includes a biography of Ann Allen written by Russell Bidlack, a history of the Detroit observatory by Patricia Whitesell, and an updated edition of Howard Peckham's history of the University of Michigan. There have been two newsletters published by the unit, the Michigan Historical Collection Gazette published from 1967 to 1988 and the Bentley Historical Library which began publication in 1989 and continues to the present.,  The Sub-Unit Publications series contains undated brochures from the Friends of the Bentley Historical Library.",,"Annual reports., Newsletters., Bibliographies., Bulletins., Brochures., Calendars., Manuals., Monographs., Reports.",,,"Michigan Historical Collections., Bentley Historical Library.","The origins of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL) can be traced to two related projects initiated in the 1930s at the University of Michigan. In early 1934, Professor Lewis G. Vander Velde successfully applied for a $700 grant to locate and collect primary source material relating to the history of Michigan. Approximately a year later, in November 1935, University of Michigan President Alexander Ruthven appointed a Committee on University Archives and authorized it to gather together the university's historical records. Vander Velde served as secretary to this committee. Space was set aside in the William L. Clements Library for both projects, and Vander Velde, with the assistance of a single graduate student, undertook both projects. In June 1938, the two enterprises moved into three rooms of the newly completed Rackham Building. That same year the Regents named the endeavor the Michigan Historical Collections (MHC). In 1973, the library moved from its quarters in the Rackham Building into the newly completed Bentley Historical Library on the university's north campus. For the first time, the MHC had for a home a facility designed and built for the processing and use of the manuscript and archival materials that it had been collecting for nearly forty years.,  In the formative years of the MHC, Vander Velde supervised a surprisingly large staff. Funds from the Works Progress Administration made possible the hiring of a large number of special assistants. In 1939, twenty individuals were packing, processing, and cleaning records as they were collected. Although World War II quickly drained away the funds used to pay these many employees, a great deal of work was accomplished and Vander Velde retained some professional assistance. In 1938 or 1939, Vander Velde hired a full-time assistant primarily to collect historical records. In 1951, he added a permanent printed works librarian to the staff.,  In 1947, Vander Velde was appointed chair of the university's history department. To lighten his administrative burden at the MHC, F. Clever Bald was appointed to the newly created post, assistant director. Vander Velde retained the title of director of the MHC until 1960, when he retired and was succeeded by Bald. In 1966 Bald retired and was succeeded by Robert M. Warner. In 1980, Warner resigned as director to become head of the National Archives. Richard Doolen served as acting director until 1981 when Francis X. Blouin, Jr. became the fourth director of the BHL. Blouin would serve as director until 2013.,  In 1979, a separate program for the administration of the university archives was formally established. The University Archives and Records Program (UARP) became a separate division alongside the MHC, which continued to focus on documenting the state of Michigan. Reference services and conservation were reconfigured as divisions providing the current structure of four divisions (MHC, UARP, Reference and Access, and Preservation and Conservation) under the broader designation of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL). A fifth division, Digital Curation was added to the BHL in April 2011 to handle the preservation and archiving of digital records.,  Issued in 2004 on the occasion of the dedication of an addition to its building The Bentley Historical Library Its History and Purpose provides a more complete history of the Bentley Historical Library.

7,umich-bhl-851831-f,"The television production studio and media services unit of the University of Michigan, commonly referred to as ""Michigan Media."" It was formed in 1978 through the merger of the university Television Center and the university Audio-Visual Education Center. The Television Center began producing educational programs for broadcast on commercial and public stations in 1950. The Audio-Visual Education Center produced films for the university and operated a film distribution library. The Media Resources Center closed in 1986. The collection consists of documentary type film and video and film and video of television programs produced by the Media Resources Center and its predecessors.",The material is in English,"The University of Michigan Media Resources Center Films and Videotapes collection consists of ""archives"" film footage produced or collected by the Center and television programs and films produced by the Center. The ""archives"" films are divide into three series; Archives Film (Series AF), Film File (Series AF) and Audio-Visual Education Center Film File Series AVEC Film File. The television programs are organized based on the,   Archives Films,  The ""archival films"": consist of documentary style, 16mm film footage of a variety of University of Michigan events, buildings, and personalities. The series originated in 1959 when the Television Center began a project to create a ""university film archives."" Some of this footage was shot for the purpose of being incorporated into television programs, but much of the filming was done simply to create a film record of the university. Filming was done on a regular basis through about 1972. After that date the Michigan Media collection includes comparatively few ""archival"" films.,  The subject matter of the archival films falls into several broad categories:, Films in the three archival series range from a few minutes to more than an hour in length. The films may be negatives, original positives, or work prints. Some are identified as ""trims,"" i.e. original footage edited out of finished productions. The work prints have often been cut and spliced and portions may be missing. Several titles were originally recorded on either two- or one-videotape reels or directly on 3/4-inch videotape cassette.,  The early films, ca 1953-ca.1963, are generally black and white. After 1963 color film is more common. Many of the films, especially, from the early years, are silent. For some of these there are accompanying 16mm magnetic sound tracks or 1/4-inch reel-to-reel audio tapes.,  The film description part of the finding aid is arranged by series film number or titles. Film numbers were assigned by the Television Center in an approximate chronological order. The description of individual films is based on a card File created by the Television Center and on a viewing of each film by Bentley staff.,  The descriptive record for each film includes the film number; title; date; a brief summary of the content of the film; a listing of significant persons appearing in the film; and technical information on the color, sound, polarity, and length of the film.,  The films are stored in canisters, usually on a core rather than a reel. A film number generally refers to an individual film title. There is sometimes more than one film number in a canister and occasionally more than one film number on a single reel or core. Alternate versions of a title are indicated by a lower case letter.,  The Television Center gave the films titles which are more or less descriptive. These titles have been retained except for a few instances in which a more descriptive title was assigned or in which a uniform title was created for all parts of a multi-reel film. The individual reels of multi-part titles are designated by a lower case letter, e.g. 98a, 98b, 98c. For some titles the may be more than one film, possibly a negative, positive, work print, or other version. A few tittles have been digitized and are available on DVD and streaming files.,  The listing for each film or program in includes a Title, date of production, and abstract/summary of the content of the film and ,when available, the names of persons or organizations featured in the film. University of Michigan faculty and staff are identified by departmental or administrative affiliation (e.g. Peter Gosling, UM-Geog. A list of abbreviations used is included in the Additional Descriptive Data Section of this finding aid.) Technical information for the films is provided in the format: Original: 16mm film, pos, b/w, sil, 343, 00:09:35. The order of the information is:, Television Programs and AVEC Films,  The Television Programs consist of 16mm kinescope films and two-inch and 1-inch videotapes of programs produced by the Center for distribution to commercial and educational television stations. The collection represents only a portion of the television programs produced by the Center. There were no extant copies of some programs when the library acquired the collection.,  The films and videotapes in the Michigan Media collection were appraised and only a portion have been selected for permanent retention by the Bentley Historical Library. A number of appraisal criteria were used in determining which television programs and films were retained:, The television programs are organized by series created by the Center. The series for the most part reflect different type of programming the Center produced, from the earliest ""telecourses"" to the independent programs produced under the title ""Understanding Our World"". to the multi-part programs that were the core of the ""University of Michigan Television Hour. See the History section for details on the different series.,  The description for individual programs includes the title and date of the program, a unique id number, and an abstract of the content of the program with listing of the host and guests on the program. A program may exist in one or more formats: kinescope negative, kinescope positive and 1-inch or 2-inch videotape. Technical information for each program is recorded in the format16mm kinescope film, neg. #511, Pos. #665, 2-inch video #458. (the negative number was treated as a production and for some programs recorded originally on videotape a negative was not actually produced). The television programs were generally either twelve, fifteen or thirty minutes in length Most are black and white and all have sound.,  In 2009 a selection of television programs and films and tapes were digitized. for each tape or film selected a preservation Beta SP tape was made as well as a DVD use copy and a streaming file (mpeg4 and Flash).

Television Center.","The Media Resources Center, commonly referred to as ""Michigan Media,"" served as the University of Michigan's television studio and media services unit. Michigan Media was created in 1978 through the merger of the university Television Center and the university Audio-Visual Education Center. The University of Michigan Television Center (TVC), founded in 1950, produced television programs for broadcast on commercial and educational television stations. Although it never operated its own on-the-air television station, the TVC developed a unique ""network"" by distributing film and videotape of programs for broadcast by local stations across the country.,  The Audio-Visual Education Center (AVEC) was formed out of the university Extension Division's Visual Education Bureau. Originally it was primarily a film distribution unit, providing instructional films to the state's elementary and secondary schools and a variety of adult organizations. As the Visual Education Bureau's activities began to center more on serving the university campus, an autonomous Audio-Visual Education Center was created. The AVEC produced and distributed instructional films as well as promotional films for the university. It also produced films on a contract basis for non-university clients.,  Michigan Media also provided closed-circuit and other television services for the university, produced films about the university, collected archival film footage of university events, and provided consultation, maintenance and technical support services for media projects in other university units. In addition to television production, Michigan Media was responsible for the AVEC film distribution library and for increased special project film production. Michigan Media was disbanded in 1987 after a unit review and its functions were eliminated or distributed to other university units.,  The University of Michigan Television Center and, later, Michigan Media were widely recognized as pioneers in the development of educational television programming. Along with Johns Hopkins, Michigan was one of the first universities to produce educational programs. The TVC developed the concepts of the ""telecourse"" and the ""trigger film."" Over the years, Television Center and Michigan Media productions won numerous awards from professional organizations and film festivals.,  The Television Center's first facilities were located in the Speech Department offices in Angell Hall. In 1951/52 the TVC occupied rooms in South Quad and set up a temporary closed-circuit studio in an Angell Hall classroom. The TVC's first working studio was established in the former Dolph Funeral Home building at 310 Maynard Street in Ann Arbor in January 1954. The studio and offices were moved to the Argus Building on West 4th Street in Ann Arbor in 1978.,  The university's first experience with television production involved the broadcast of student dramas on WWJ-TV, Detroit on an irregularly scheduled program entitled ""On Camera."" The plays, written and acted by UM students and directed by faculty, were rehearsed on campus. Actors and sets were then taken to WWJ's studios for the live broadcast. Nine plays were televised between 1948 and 1953. Several UM faculty members had also participated in the WWJ produced series ""University of the Air."",  In the summer of 1950 officials of WWJ proposed to UM president Alexander Ruthven and a group of faculty that the university participate in production of a series of television programs to be called ""The University of Michigan Hour."" The station guaranteed the university one hour of air time each week on Sunday afternoon and proposed to pay participating faculty members. The station attached two conditions to the offer: that some form of college credit be awarded and that a tuition fee be charged to each registered viewer.,  A special university committee considered and accepted WWJ's proposal in September 1950. Garnet Garrison was appointed to the newly created post of Director of Television. Garrison had received a master's degree in speech from UM and then worked in New York for NBC radio. He also taught radio announcing at Columbia University. In 1947 Garrison had accepted a position in the UM Department of Speech. He would be the guiding spirit of University of Michigan television for more than twenty years.,  Production of UM Television Hour programs began in 1950. The first program aired November 5, 1950. In accord with WWJ's wishes, the one hour of air time was divided into three twenty minute segments: a liberal arts program running for fourteen weeks, a practical living program to run seven weeks, and a weekly ""showcase for the university."" The term ""telecourse"" was coined to describe the programs of the first two segments. Each of the telecourses was to feature a UM faculty member and was to be aimed at an adult audience. It was decided not to offer regular university credits for the telecourses but rather to provide each registering viewer with a certificate of participation. A minimal registration fee was charged and each registrant was provided a course outline and other supplementary material.,  The third segment of Television Hour was named the ""Teletour."" It was designed to be a ""weekly invitation to the people of Michigan to visit one of the many institutions of the university."" The teletours were usually broadcast from the WWJ studios with a faculty or staff member using a variety of props and visual aids to describe some university institution or activity. Approximately once a month the WWJ remote truck came to Ann Arbor and the teletour was broadcast live from campus.,  The telecourse programs were written by the participating professors and TVC staff. Rehearsals were conducted in the TVC facilities in Angell Hall. On Sunday morning, stars, staff, and props were transported to Detroit for the live broadcast from WWJ's studio. Because the telecourses were done live without recording equipment, no film record of the original telecourses exists. Later, several telecourses were redone and recorded on kinescope film.,  Other commercial stations soon expressed an interest in broadcasting UM programs. In September 1951 stations WJIM in Lansing and WKZO in Kalamazoo began simultaneous broadcast of the live WWJ programs via a microwave relay hookup.,  Station WOOD approached the Television Center with a proposal to begin broadcasting a second series of live programs from its studio in Grand Rapids. The station offered to provide one half-hour of air time on Saturday afternoon but insisted that the series consist of original productions, not rebroadcasts of WWJ programs. WOOD wanted individual programs of general interest that were not part of a ""telecourse."" The TVC and WOOD agreed on a format and began broadcasting a series of independent programs under the title ""Understanding Our World"" in March 1952. These programs were developed and rehearsed at the UM campus and then broadcast live from WOOD studios.,  A third request for TVC programming came in 1953 from WPAG, the UHF station in Ann Arbor. The station requested two and three quarters hours of non-commercial programming each week. An arrangement was reached whereby the TVC provided studio facilities, equipment, and technical assistance and the UM Speech Department provided programming and student staff as part of its television production courses. The WPAG programming was intended to serve as an on the air laboratory for speech students interested in television production. Several series were broadcast including community and university news, interviews with local and university personalities, and programs aimed at elementary school children. Approximately 340 programs were broadcast from October 1953 to the spring of 1957 when WPAG went off the air. Only a few of these programs were recorded on film.,  The format of the UM Television Hour was modified in the fall of 1952. The telecourse portions of the TV Hour were expanded to one half-hour each. The Teletour segment was moved to a new time slot at 5:45 Saturday evening. This program, now 15 minutes long, was renamed ""Michigan Reports"" (Series H). Beginning in the fall of 1955 the name was changed again to ""Accent: Michigan Report."" It was broadcast under that name through 1961 when the program was discontinued. Throughout, the series served as a public relations program for the university, showing the public the variety of activities taking place at the University of Michigan.,  The telecourse programs were discontinued in April 1954. Declining numbers of registrants was one factor prompting the abandonment of TV programs for which certificates of participation were issued. Other universities had begun to offer television courses for full college credit under the term telecourse. Michigan did not wish to be associated with these for-credit courses and therefore stopped issuing certificates of participation and dropped the use of the designation telecourse.,  Thereafter the Television Hour consisted of two half-hour programs of general interest. The first was a series of multi-part programs of from five to thirty segments. The programs generally featured university faculty discussing and presenting material on topics such as medicine and health, national and international affairs, science, history, and other academic subjects. Some 130 different programs were broadcast between 1954 and 1980.,  The second portion of the TV hour was given over to the ""Understanding Our World"" series (Series B) originally created for station WOOD. Though there were several multi-part programs, the series generally consisted of self-contained programs. The programs often featured UM faculty but also included local, national, and even international personalities. The format of the programs included interviews, panel discussions, demonstrations, and documentaries. Over 800 individual programs were broadcast between 1954 and 1980 covering a wide variety of subjects.,  The TVC developed a unique network through which UM programs were broadcast over commercial and public stations across the country. The first UM television network was the ""live"" hook-up of stations WJIM and WKZO to carry the programs broadcast from the WWJ-TV studios. Completion of the Maynard Street facilities on the UM campus and purchase of a kinescope camera allowed the TVC to produce and record programs in its own studio. The kinescope process recorded the ""live"" television signal on 16 millimeter film. Copies of the film were made and distributed through the mail to local television stations for broadcast at a time of their choosing. A two-inch videotape recording machine was acquired in 1963, permitting distribution of TVC programs in both film and videotape formats.,  By the mid-1960s more than 120 television stations had broadcast TVC programs. Stations joined and left the network at various times but distribution of UM programs remained high until the mid-1970s. By that time the development of the public television system and declining demand for educational programming from commercial stations combined to weaken the market for TVC programming.,  The TVC was also involved in special project programming and non-broadcast film production as well as in providing media services to other campus units. Significant special projects included re-creating and recording several telecourses for the Educational Television and Radio Center (ETRC), production of programs for the Midwest Project for Airborne Television Instruction (MPATI) and the Medical Television project.,  The ETRC, a Ford Foundation sponsored center to promote development of television as an educational medium, provided funding for the TVC to re-create and record on kinescope film three of the telecourse programs and to develop several new programs. ETRC then distributed the kinescopes to educational television stations throughout the country. The TVC videotaped approximately 100 programs for MPATI, a Purdue University-based project that broadcast educational programming over a six-state area via an aircraft with on-board video broadcasting capabilities. Among TVC productions for MPATI were a 64-part series on American literary history titled ""From Franklin to Frost,"" intended for use in high schools, and an elementary Spanish course.,  The TVC cooperated with the Medical School to develop the capacity for closed-circuit broadcasting and recording of surgical and diagnostic procedures for use in Medical School courses. Similar projects were undertaken for the Law School, Zoology Department, and other university units. The TVC also produced public relations films for the university and a variety of instructional films not intended for broadcast use.,  An innovative concept developed by Michigan Media was the ""trigger film."" These were short, open-ended dramatic vignettes designed to illustrate some problem or conflict situation and to promote discussion among the viewers. Trigger films were produced on a variety of topics including teenage driving, drug abuse, aging, and dormitory living. The trigger films were recognized with an Osella award from the 1969 Venice International Film Festival.,  In 1959 the TVC began to compile what it called a ""university film archives."" The TVC filmed many university events including awards ceremonies, building groundbreakings and dedications, retirement banquets, graduations, athletic events and marching band performances, homecoming and other social activities, student protests, visits by dignitaries, and general footage of campus buildings and scenes. This archival film was intended in part to provide stock footage for television and film production, but was also a conscious effort to document the university through film.,  When the TVC was founded in 1950 it was placed under the administrative control of the director of University Relations. A Broadcasting Committee oversaw the activities of the TVC. The TVC was headed by a director of Broadcasting, a position held by Garnet R. Garrison from 1950 to 1958. In 1958 the director's responsibilities were expanded to include management of the university radio service. Hazen Schumacher was then placed in charge of television operations as associate director of Television. Schumacher became director of Broadcasting upon Garrison's retirement in 1973.,  A major reorganization of media services occurred in 1978. The Television Center was merged with the Audio-Visual Education Center to form the University of Michigan Media Resources Center, commonly referred to as Michigan Media. The AVEC developed out of the broadcasting service of the university Extension Service. It had produced filmstrips, audiotapes, and films for use both within and outside the university. Some AVEC films were made for broadcast but most were intended for use by schools, community groups, and other organizations. AVEC had also developed a large film lending library to serve the university, schools, and community organizations.,  Michigan Media provided a variety of media services for the university ranging from film production to consulting, engineering services, equipment service and repair, film and tape duplication, and classroom instruction. For a short time it was also the university computer repair service.,  In the early 1980s the original television production was scaled back considerably as the demand for educational programming was increasingly met by educational television stations and commercial production companies. Michigan Media also experienced a significant downsizing imposed during the university's fiscal crisis of the early 1980s.,  Michigan Media underwent a university review in 1986. The review panel recommended that MM be retained but that its structure and function be significantly modified. Ultimately, however, it was decided that Michigan Media should be disbanded and its functions eliminated or distributed to other units. The television studio and other media production facilities and staff were divided between the College of Literature, Science and the Arts and the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching. The film and video library was placed under the management of the Undergraduate Library. Michigan Media formally ceased to exist on June 30, 1988.,  Some Michigan Media scripts and other paper records had been transferred to the Bentley Library between 1968 and 1978. The remainder of the Michigan Media records were transferred to the Bentley in 1988.",

He attended the University of Pittsburgh (1910-1911) and received his LL.B. from the University of Michigan in 1913. In the same year, he was admitted to the Michigan Bar and practiced law in the state until 1929.,  While serving as circuit court judge for Wayne County (1929-1941), Ferguson achieved fame when he sat as a One-Man grand jury (1939-1941) investigating crime, graft, and corruption in Detroit and Wayne County. Shortly thereafter, in 1942, he was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate and was re-elected in 1948.,  Ferguson's fame as a tough investigator grew during his tenure in the senate, when he sat on committees that drew public attention because of the probes and inquiries they initiated. Included among these committees were: Appropriations; Expenditures in the Executive Department; Judiciary; Special Committee Investigating the National Defense Program; and the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack. A conservative who was always interested in efficiency in government, the Senator was also appointed to the Hoover Commission on the Reorganization of the Executive Branch of the Government. His interest in international affairs was evident in his long-term participation, both during and after his senatorial career, in the activities of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a body of representatives from the parliaments of countries around the world that met approximately once a year to study issues of international concern related to law, economics, and world peace.,  Shortly after losing his 1954 bid for a third senatorial term, Ferguson became United States Ambassador to the Philippines where he served for thirteen months (1955-1956). He thereupon returned to Washington, D.C., and sat for fifteen years on the United States Court of Military Appeals - the equivalent of the Supreme Court for the armed forces. Though his term expired in 1971, Ferguson continued on as a senior judge and rendered verdicts on various cases for another five years.,  In 1976, the judge and his wife of sixty-three years, Myrtle, retired to Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Homer Ferguson died there on December 17, 1982.",
9,umich-bhl-85193,"U. S. Senator from Michigan, 1959-1976, a conscientious supporter of civil rights, consumer protection and environmentalism, Hart served as floor manager of the 1965 civil rights act and 1968 Open Housing Act, introduced legislation to create Sleeping Bear Dunes and Pictured Rock National Lakeshores and sponsored important consumer legislation. Papers include Legislative Files, Staff Files, Press Files, Subject Files, Constituent Correspondence, Office Files, Political Files, Miscellaneous, Sound Recordings, and Visual Materials.",The materials are in English.,"The Philip A. Hart collection consists of those files maintained by Hart and his staff in Washington D.C. while serving as senator from Michigan in the period 1958-1976. A senate office in the 1960s and 1970s could employ as many as thirty staff and clerical workers. In 1975, Hart wrote: ""My own office presently consists of 34 full-time people in Washington plus 4 in my Detroit office and one part-time employee each in Grand Rapids and Marquette."" Received from Washington, the Hart collection documents the workings of his Capitol office. Excepting for a few files from the 1950s when Hart served in Michigan state government, the Hart papers relate exclusively to Senate activities and detail the variety and bulk of problems crossing the desk of a United States senator and his staff.,  In a press release describing his office, Hart stated that the work of a senator falls into three categories: legislative, participating in the discussion and formulation of public policy, and serving as ""ambassador"" between his constituents and the Federal Government. Beyond the study of legislation, public policy debates, and the relationship between a senator and the people of his state, the Hart collection is a reflection of the times in which Hart served, the sixties and seventies, years of the presidencies of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford, a time when public figures discussed issues of conscience and of war, matters of human rights and of public morality, areas where Hart's basic integrity and humaneness placed him in the forefront of public debate.,  The collection falls into eleven principal series: Personal/Biographical, Legislative Files, Staff Files, Press Files, Subject Files, Constituent Correspondence, Office Files, Political Files, Miscellaneous, Sound Recordings, and Visual Materials. Except for Personal/Biographical and the series of audio-visual materials, the Hart collection is an office file and represents the activities of one senator and a dozen or so of his key staff members. To use the collection, the researcher after examining the ""Series Description"" (on the following pages) should note that for any topical study, information will usually be found in any number of series within the collection. The series represent functional divisions within the Hart office, legislation, press, or whatever. To study an issue such as consumer protection, therefore, the researcher should be prepared to examine the Hart finding aid under the series that might document that topic from different functional perspectives (Legislative Files, Staff Files, Subject Files, among others). The researcher interested in a narrower, more specific topic should recognize that the following inventory, for the most part, is not a folder-level description and thus specialized kinds of information will be filed first under a more general heading.,  One more note: The Hart papers originally consisted of more than 700 linear feet of files. Hart himself and his staff had discarded certain types of files before donating them to the library, notably case files and constituent mail answered by form. In addition, the library discarded files of low research content - thank yous, invitations, and carbons of Hart correspondence duplicated in the other principal series of the collection. Furthermore, files containing similar types of correspondence from constituents have been sampled (the folders have ""S"" or ""Samp"" on them). Government publications, easily available in a government documents library, and unless heavily annotated, have been discarded. Researchers on any topic within the Hart collection should familiarize themselves with the standard sources on government documents (the indices to the Congressional Record for example). Topics on which Hart played a key legislative role or about which he was keenly interested have not been sampled. These topics include civil rights, the passage of various consumer legislation, the Sleeping Bear Dunes debate, his committee work, and the debate over the war in Vietnam to list a few.","Antimissile missiles., Antitrust law., Automobiles -- Pollution control devices., Civil rights -- United States., Conservation of natural resources -- United States., Consumer protection., Elections -- Michigan -- 1964., Elections -- Michigan -- 1970., Environmental protection -- United States., Legislators -- United States., Vietnamese Conflict, 1961-1975., Conservation of natural resources -- United States., Politics and government -- 1946-1960., Politics and government -- 1961-1970., Politics and government -- 1971-1980., Riots.","Cartoons., DVD., Motion pictures., Photographs., Videotapes.","Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1946-1960., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1961-1970., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1971-1980., Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (Mich.), Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (Mich.), United States -- Politics and government -- 1945-1989., Detroit (Mich.), Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (Mich.), Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (Mich.)","Hart, Philip A.

Hart was United States Senator from Michigan, serving from 1959 until his death in December of 1976. Born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania on December 10, 1912, Hart graduated from Georgetown University in 1934 and the University of Michigan Law School in 1937. He practiced law in Detroit for four years until the outbreak of war when he enlisted in the United States Army. He served until 1946, and was wounded during the D-Day assault on Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion.,  Following the war, Hart returned to the law and embarked on a career in public service. His law school classmate Governor G. Mennen Williams appointed him to the Michigan Corporation Securities Commission (1949-1951); he served as state director of the Office of Price Stabilization (1951-1952), and as United States district attorney of the Eastern Michigan District (1952-1953). As Williams established himself as governor, he relied increasingly on the demonstrated abilities of Hart, serving as his legal advisor (1953-1954), and as lieutenant governor (1955-1958).,  In 1958 Hart was elected to the United States Senate where he served for eighteen years, winning decisive reelections in 1964 and again in 1970. Poor health decided Hart against running for reelection in 1976. He died December 26, 1976, a few weeks from completing his third full term.,  As Senator, Hart earned the reputation of being an honest, hard-working, and conscientious spokesman for the policies and programs of the Democratic party and for liberal Democratic causes in general. When he first came to the Senate, Hart was appointed to two committees: Agriculture and Forestry, and Judiciary. He remained a member of the Judiciary throughout his three terms in the Senate, serving as chairman of its subcommittees on antitrust and monopoly and refugees and escapees in addition to being a member of various other subcommittees relating to immigration, juvenile delinquency, and patents and copyrights. With less interest in matters of agriculture, Hart in 1963 shifted over to the Commerce Committee, where he came to serve as chairman of its subcommittee on energy, natural resources and environment (name later changed to environment) and vice chairman of its consumer affairs subcommittee. Beyond responsibilities associated with these two committees, Hart was member at various times of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, and the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities among others.,  Although he was a sponsor or key sponsor of many pieces of legislation, Hart himself was proudest of his work as floor manager of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Open Housing-Civil Rights Bill, his championing of the legislation to make Michigan's Sleeping Bear Dunes and Pictured Rocks national lakeshores, and his sponsorship of consumer-related legislation (e.g. truth-in-packaging, truth-in-lending, and truth-in-spending).",

The clipping file is a useful starting point for information on particular events, individuals, issues, organizations, and subjects. In some instances the clippings supplement material held in the archives and provide detailed background on a variety of subjects as presented by local newspapers.

Kahn, professor of bacteriology and serology at the University of Michigan from 1928 to 1956, is best known for developing the Kahn precipitation test for syphilis. However, Kahn, who remained an active researcher until the age of 85, also carried out extensive research in the areas of tissue immunity and cancer irradiation. In addition to his contributions to the medical profession, Kahn was actively concerned with civil rights and human understanding.,  Reuben Kahn was born in Lithuania in 1887 and immigrated to America with his family at age 12. He first became interested in medical research as an undergraduate at Valparaiso University. After graduating from here in 1909 he obtained an M.S. from Yale in 1913 and a D.Sc. from New York University in 1916. From 1917 to 1919 Kahn served in the Army Sanitary Corp.,  In 1923, while working as an immunologist for the Michigan State Department of Health, Kahn developed the precipitation test for syphilis, which came to be known as the Kahn test. He was appointed director of laboratories of the University Hospitals at the University of Michigan in 1928, where he also became professor of bacteriology and, in 1957, professor of serology. During the 1930's Kahn began his work on tissue immunity, studying the capacity of tissue to localize foreign substances. In 1956, at the age of 69, he became involved in research on the subject of irradiation and tissue localization. This research continued into the 1970's, funded by the Atomic Energy Commission from 1957 to 1967, the American Cancer Society from 1967 to 1969, and the National Cancer Institute from 1969 to 1973. Although Kahn retired from the University of Michigan faculty in 1956, he ,continued to carry out his research at Michigan until 1968 when he became professor of microbiology at Howard University, retiring in 1973.,  Kahn and his wife, Dina, were active in the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Kahn's concern with racial equality was demonstrated as early as 1928, when he hired the first black to work in the University Medical Center laboratories. Kahn died in 1979.,  The Kahn papers are likely to prove of most interest to biographers and to researchers interested in Kahn's experiments and his approach to research. The correspondence series provides insight into both Kahn's family life and his professional development. Speeches and papers in the collection give an indication of his personal philosophy. Materials relating to his research mostly concern his later studies on tissue immunity and irradiation. The Kahn papers are also significant as an indication of the potential contribution of older people to society.",Kahn family.

The resulting 54 reels of microfilm represent the most important, but not all, of the Quezon papers. The papers span the period beginning with Quezon's residence in Washington DC as Resident Commissioner and ending with his death in New York State during World War II. There is no material relating to his public service in Mindoro or Tayabas Province, approximately 1903-1909, or to his education.,  The collection is of greatest importance for the wide range of Quezon's correspondence and for the documentation of the events and politics involved in the long history of the Philippine independence movement. Quezon corresponded widely both with political figures in the United States as well as with the other great leaders within the Philippines.,  Due to the sensitivity of the positions he held, especially before independence, Quezon had cause to devise codes which he used in his correspondence. Staff members of the National Library have prepared a glossary of these words and numerical codes with their meaning. These code indices cover different chronological periods: Code I: 1911-1912; Code II: 1911 and January-July 1914; Code III: 1914-1915 (also known as the War Department code); Code IV: 1917-1929; Code V: 1930s.

He began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the fall of 1955. Halfway through his junior year, he took a break from school for a nine-month hitchhiking trip around Europe with a friend from MIT, during which he deepened a love for photography that had begun in high school. When Solomon returned to MIT, he enrolled in a few sociology courses, including one taught by renowned scholar Lucian Pye. After graduating with an S.B. in chemistry in 1960, Solomon immediately enrolled in MIT's graduate program in political science, working closely with Pye. Solomon received a scholarship to study Chinese at Yale during the summer of 1961, and continued studying the language at Harvard during the course of his Ph.D. He then received a research fellowship to travel to Asia to complete his dissertation, focusing particularly on Taiwan and Hong Kong. For this project, he aimed to study Chinese political culture by interviewing one hundred Chinese refugees who had fled mainland China. The interviewees were comprised of three generations: those who had lived most of their lives under the Ching dynasty that had collapsed in 1912; those who had lived during the Warlord era (the period from 1916-1927 during which China was broken up into various regions, each of which was controlled by a local ruler); and those who had grown up under communism (Chairman Mao Zedong's 1949 founding of the People's Republic of China saw the solidification of communism in China)., Solomon completed his Ph.D in Political Science and Chinese Politics in 1966, and began his teaching position at the University of Michigan almost immediately after. He spent five years as a Political Science professor at the University before joining the National Security Council under Henry Kissinger as a Senior Staff member for Asian Affairs in 1971. During this time Solomon, Kissinger, and others helped develop the so-called ""ping pong diplomacy,"" named for the development of friendly relations between the US and Chinese ping pong teams in the early 1970s that resulted in the American team's visit to China in 1971, and the Chinese team's subsequent visit to the US in 1972. President Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao used the success of these trips to help normalize relations between the two countries. , In 1976, Solomon joined the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit think tank focused on national security and domestic public policy, as the head of the Political Science Department as well as associate director of the Research Program on International Security and Defense Policy. He remained there until 1986, when he left to join the US Department of State as the Director of Policy Planning, and was later appointed assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. It was in this position that Solomon helped to advance the US relationship with the Soviet Union (until it dissolved in 1991), encouraged the discussion of nuclear issues between North and South Korea, and helped negotiate the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements that ended the Cambodian-Vietnamese war. , President George H. W. Bush appointed Solomon U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines in 1992. Solomon served for six months, after which he served as president of the United States Institute of Peace from 1993-2012, a federally funded, nonpartisan institution that focuses on nonviolent resolutions of conflicts. In 2012, Solomon returned to the Rand Corporation as a senior fellow researching international diplomacy., Solomon wrote over a dozen works, including Mao's Revolution and the Chinese Political Culture (1971) and the influential Chinese Political Negotiating Behavior, 1967-1984 (1995). He also received multiple awards in his lifetime, including the State Department's Foreign Affairs Award for Public Service in 1995 and the American Political Science Association's Hubert H.

They came from several sources: the Camp office in Ann Arbor, the Tremaine family, an alumni leader, and various administrators at Interlochen, but the greatest proportion was assembled from Maddy's home and Interlochen offices, after his death, by Margaret (Peg) Stace, his long-time assistant.,  The Camp files for 1935-1945 comprise the major portion received in their original order, and they were in disarray because of frequent changes in Camp secretaries and the practice of moving the office (along with relevant files) from Ann Arbor to Interlochen and back each summer. Also, Maddy kept many items of a personal and confidential nature at home.,  In processing the records, an attempt was made both to preserve the original order, where ascertainable, and to highlight major subjects and individuals, some of whose importance only became apparent with the passage of time. A separate name index is available for major correspondents. Where extant, explanatory historical and background information has been placed at the front of records categories. Because of Maddy's influence on the development of Interlochen both past and present, his correspondence with later administrators has been included if practical, under ""Administration"" in their papers.,  The surviving records have been divided into nine series: Chronological, Subject, Post-Maddy Administrators, Boards, Closed, Printed, Visual Materials, Sound Recordings, and Scrapbooks. The Chronological focuses on Maddy and the Camp until 1966 while the Subject, is composed of two subseries. The first, mainly 1928-1989, though also heavily relating to Maddy, also includes much on developments through the '90s. The second subseries, 1930-2003, Later Acquisition represents a group of files that were acquired in 2005. Many files pertain to the early camp and Joesph Maddy. The Post-Maddy Administrators series begins in the late 1950's when Maddy expanded the staff in anticipation of making Interlochen a year-round institution and continues unto the most recent accession. Boards (governing bodies) starts with the Camp's founding in 1928 and ends in 1989 while the Closed series covers the Maddy, Haas, and Wilson administrations through 1971. Printed offers coverage to the present but is more complete for the early years through the 1980's. While the Visual Materials and Sound Recordings series extend from the 1920's into the 1980's, it offers best coverage from 1924 to 1942 Scrapbooks, with gaps in the early years, documents both Maddy and the Camp, beginning with the National High School Orchestra and ending with the Camp's 50th anniversary celebration in 1978.","Music -- Michigan -- Interlochen., Musicians -- Michigan -- Interlochen., Radio and music -- Michigan., Radio broadcasting -- Michigan -- Interlochen., Music camps -- Michigan -- Interlochen., Music -- Michigan -- Interlochen., Music camps -- Michigan -- Interlochen., Musicians -- Michigan -- Interlochen.","Motion pictures., Photographs., Slides., Scrapbooks., Sound recordings.","Interlochen (Mich.), Interlochen (Mich.)","Petrillo, James C.

Both his parents were educators. His father taught before becoming a banker, and his mother served as county school superintendent. Both also enjoyed performing music, especially his mother, an accomplished amateur musician. Their first son, Harry, a year and a half older, served as a role model in Joe's early musical career.,  As youths, the two brothers joined the newly formed Wellington Boys Band. Its director took the group on a musical camping trip, which Joe greatly enjoyed. Later, the boys graduated to the town band. They also performed in the family quartet, which was expanded during their early teens when another talented musical family, the Petits, moved to town. The Petits' youngest daughter, Fay, who years later eventually became Mrs. Joseph Maddy, and the two families spent part of a summer playing music while camping together.,  Since musical instruction was unavailable in the public schools, Joe Maddy, like his brother before him, dropped out of high school after his freshman year. Following two semesters at Bethany (Kansas) College of Music and Fine Arts, he transferred to the Wichita (Kansas) College of Music, which his brother attended. In 1909, having joined the musicians union, he again followed his brother, becoming the youngest member of the Minneapolis Symphony. Two years later, he married Marie Mangan, and in 1913, the first of their three children was born.,  While his brother remained for almost a half century as violinist with the Minneapolis Symphony, Joe, a violist, chaffed under the group's emphasis on seniority, rather than ability, for promotion. So in 1914, he switched to the new St. Paul Orchestra as Assistant Concertmaster.,  The economic disruptions of World War I brought a quick end to the St. Paul Orchestra and Maddy's symphonic career, leading him eventually into music education. For the next four years, he expanded his knowledge and skills in a variety of musical jobs. He became a clarinetist with a vaudeville orchestra in Peoria, Illinois. Then, he learned conducting as head of the orchestra in his native Wellington (Kansas). In 1915, he moved to Wichita Falls, Texas, as director of the College of Music and Art. There, he started a non-credit orchestra among high school students. Relocating to Chicago, he played saxophone in jazz clubs and taught in several music schools.,  In 1918, when philanthropist George Eastman created the position of superintendent of music in the Rochester, New York, public schools, Joe, because of his ability to play a variety of instruments, got the job. Although he lacked the required teaching certificate, the president of the University of Rochester, following a half hour interview, conferred the needed credential on him ""by examination."" During his two year tenure in Rochester, Maddy started school bands and orchestras which greatly impressed Eastman. Joe's efforts together with a follow-up survey by Pittsburgh music educator, Will Earhart, helped convince Eastman to endow the distinguished music school which bears his name.,  While preparing the Rochester survey, Earhart approached Maddy about becoming supervisor of school music and director of civic music in Richmond, Indiana, a position which Earhart once held. Maddy hesitated because the job included choral work, but Earhart persuaded him that a summer course at Chautauqua under T. P. Giddings, a specialist in mass choral instruction (and head of the public school music program in Minneapolis), would qualify him.,  The Chautauqua experience (1920) forged a strong bond between Maddy and Giddings. Almost immediately, they began collaborating on a master work of music instruction. Shunned initially by publishers because it contained familiar, and thus works which could not be copyrighted, it found a champion in Carl D. Greenleaf, head of C. G. Conn Company, the instrument manufacturer. Published initially by Conn in 1922, the Universal Teacher became the standard in the field, presenting the first practical system for teaching all instruments of the band and orchestra at the same time.,  During Maddy's four years in Richmond, he scored a major breakthrough by getting music accepted into the regular school curriculum with credit toward graduation. He also developed the first complete high school symphony orchestra, which, in 1922, performed before the Music Supervisors (soon renamed Educators) National Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. In preparing for the trip, Maddy initiated another major reform. Remembering his frustration with the Minneapolis Symphony, he instituted weekly challenges for position determined by the votes of orchestra members. Following four months of intensive study, Maddy passed the subject examinations for a high school diploma, and he also began teaching part-time at Earlham College in Richmond.,  In 1924, Maddy accepted a joint appointment as supervisor of music in the Ann Arbor, Michigan, public schools and head of the school music department in the University School of Music, which was affiliated with but separate from the University of Michigan. At first, he devoted most of his energies to developing the public school music program, organizing the high school band and other musical groups (where, previously, there had been only a mandolin club). By the fall of 1927, he switched totally to the conservatory, where he initiated the first conducting classes.,  A few months before moving to Ann Arbor (1924), Maddy was named a member of the new Instrumental Affairs Committee of the Music Supervisors National Conference. The committee, with gifts from the National Bureau for the Advancement of Music, headed by C. M. Tremaine, funded band and orchestra contests on both the state and national levels. In 1926, Maddy became its chairman, and with assistance from Giddings, organized the first National High School Symphony Orchestra, composed of outstanding young musicians from throughout America. Its performance at the Music Supervisors National Conference in Detroit led to an invitation to assemble a similar group for the national convention of school superintendents in Dallas, Texas, the following spring.,  The performance of the second National High School Orchestra (1927) led the superintendents to adopt a resolution that music receive ""equal consideration and support with other basic subjects"" in the public schools. An elated Joe Maddy, at a farewell party for orchestra members, promised to find them a permanent home, a summer camp where they could play music ""all day long."",  Returning to Ann Arbor, he placed an advertisement in the Sunday Detroit Free Press seeking a location for his proposed camp. Willis Pennington, owner of a resort hotel near Interlochen in northern Michigan, responded. He had vacant property close to a railroad station and to separate boys and girls camps owned by his family. After an inspection trip, Maddy and Giddings arranged a deal to board campers at the hotel in exchange for some land between the lakes. Tremaine, who served as their financial advisor, finalized the agreement in his office.,  With a loan from band instrument manufacturers plus a personal gift from Greenleaf and additional funds from Traverse City bankers, construction of the camp began. It opened on schedule, June 24, 1928, as the home of the National High School Orchestra. Representing a pioneering venture in both musical and coeducational camping, it became the first truly independent, non-college, summer camp devoted strictly to music and probably the first to incorporate male and female campers on an equal basis. From the beginning, it also accepted members of all religions, rather than following the exclusionary practices of the time. While a strong Southern constituency delayed admission of African Americans, it became a leader in the post World War II integration of private camps, producing many distinguished black alumni, including Jessye Norman.,  The first year of the National High School Orchestra Camp proved an artistic success, but a financial disaster. Ending $40,000 in the red, Maddy sold debenture bonds among supporters and area residents to meet the deficit. To protect the creditors, a Board of Control was formed to oversee the Camp's finances. It consisted of Maddy, Giddings, and Tremaine plus four creditor representatives (Pennington and three debenture holders).,  When the Camp opened for its second year, it added an alumni or college division and featured band as well as orchestra training. Shortly thereafter, with the Depression effectively ending funds for the National High School Orchestra, the Camp began to advertise itself simply as ""The National Music Camp."",  Despite a doubling of enrollment in its second year, the deficit remained and became more of a problem with the onset of the Depression. The sale of nationwide broadcast rights in 1930 helped keep the Camp open. Two years later, Maddy secured enough in gifts and new debentures to make a down payment on purchasing the Camp, but within another year, it faced immanent bankruptcy. Tremaine, the treasurer, saved the Camp by persuading Pennington and the debenture holders to accept a reduction in their payments and by instituting rigid financial controls on Maddy's spending.,  Although the Camp struggled financially, it continued to gain fame musically. In 1930, its orchestra performed in Washington, D.C., before President Herbert Hoover with Senator Arthur Vandenberg's daughter as soloist. Three years later, it played at the Century of Progress in Chicago. In 1937, an affiliation with Illinois State Normal University guaranteed college credit to members of its alumni division, and two years later, its orchestra appeared at the World's Fair in New York, conducted by nine year old child prot√©g√©, Loren Maazel. Early campers included Frederick Fennell and Seymour Lipkin, and guest artists and faculty: John Philip Sousa, Frederick Stock, Ferde Grofe, Percy Grainger, and Howard Hanson.,  Despite Maddy's success, his preoccupation with the Camp created problems at the University School of Music where he taught. Although the School became a unit of the University of Michigan in 1929, it remained at first under the control of the University Musical Society. Charles A. Sink, head of the Society, grew increasingly critical of the time Maddy devoted to the Camp, rather than the School.,  In 1930, the newly installed president of the University, Alexander Grant Ruthven, came to Maddy's rescue. Using funds from a Carnegie Foundation grant, he released Maddy from teaching for five years with instructions to promote music education as he saw fit.,  Following Ruthven's mandate, Maddy experimented with the use of radio for music instruction. In 1931, under the aegis of the U. of M. Broadcasting Service, he started band and orchestra classes over a statewide network via WJR in Detroit. Eventually, they were expanded to include string and vocal instruction and a popular hymn program. In 1936, NBC picked up his band and orchestra classes on its national network. In Maddy's radio work, he relied heavily on University of Michigan students. They included announcers Mike Wallace (Myron Wallach) for the instructional and Camp broadcasts and Ward Quaal for the hymn program and technician Jerome Wiesner (later president of MIT), who also helped found the radio workshop at the Camp.,  The same year (1936) as Maddy began his national broadcasts, he assumed the presidency of the Music Educators National Conference (MENC). Not surprisingly, educational broadcasting served as the theme of his inaugural address. Upon completion of his two-year term, he became director (1938-1940) of the MENC program, ""Music and American Youth,"" which featured broadcasts of school music groups throughout the United States.,  In addition to his radio work, Maddy, under the sponsorship of the university Extension Service, served as conductor for all-state, regional, and national high school orchestras and supervised state and national school band and orchestra contests and festivals. Often, he arranged his appearances in conjunction with his broadcasts, and everywhere he recruited students for the Camp.,  Despite the successes, Maddy and the Camp experienced a series of crises at the end of the 1930's. Maddy's first marriage disintegrated, and he and Giddings battled over control of Interlochen. Meanwhile, Camp finances remained tight, and the expiration of Maddy's Carnegie grant at the university brought him into renewed conflict with the head of the University Musical Society. Finally, in 1939, NBC, given the growing commercial demand for air time, canceled his nationwide instructional program.,  In 1937, Maddy divorced his first wife, Marie, who served as Interlochen's secretary. His remarriage a year later to his childhood friend, Fay Petit, a professional musician, restored happiness to his personal life, but the problem with Giddings remained.,  Facing imminent retirement from the Minneapolis school system, Giddings opposed Maddy over the choice of Camp director and university affiliation. In order to force a settlement, Tremaine, who supported Maddy, threatened to resign. The tactic worked; the crisis passed, and amiable relations were restored (lasting until Giddings' death in 1954). Thereafter, Maddy, though occasionally restrained in fiscal policy by Tremaine and the Board of Trustees, lacked a serious rival in operating the Camp.,  The easing of the Depression and a Hollywood movie contract, resulting in Paramount Pictures There's Magic in Music (1940), finally brought prosperity to the Camp. At the end of the 1941 season, Pennington exchanged the deed to the property for a mortgage on the amount due. Two years later, the mortgage was retired, and in another year, the debentures paid. The Camp also expanded, purchasing Camp Penn Loch (the new Junior Camp for Boys) in 1942 and Interlochen (the new Junior Girls Camp) in 1944 from members of the Pennington family.,  Maddy's situation at the University of Michigan also improved. Early in 1940, Ruthven named Maddy acting director of Broadcasting Service, and soon afterward, the university took full control of the School of Music from the Musical Society. The new dean, Earl V. Moore, supported Maddy's work at the Camp. In 1942, when the contract with Illinois State University expired, the U. of M. assumed responsibility for the college division, and a year later, transferred its summer All-State high school program to Interlochen.,  After the reduction in Maddy's instructional broadcasts, he turned to the civic orchestra movement as a means of utilizing graduates of his programs. In the fall of 1939, he surveyed civic music directors throughout the country, and the following summer, he convened a meeting at the Camp to discuss ""mutual problems."" Within a year, he assumed leadership of the Ann Arbor Civic (Symphony) Orchestra, and working for the U. of M. Extension Service, formed the Michigan Civic Orchestra Association to promote mass orchestra performances.,  When America entered World War II, Governor Murray Van Wagoner appointed Maddy head of Michigan's Wartime Civic Music program to promote the war effort. As usual, Maddy based many of his activities at the Camp. In 1942, he held the organizing conference there, and the following year, a Clinic for civic music directors. Despite a battle with publishers over copyright, his group produced a patriotic songbook for general use. With university backing, he also led musical performances throughout the state and broadcast patriotic music over a network of Michigan stations fed by WJR in Detroit.,  Just as the outlook for Maddy and the Camp improved, they suffered a double blow. The introduction of wartime restrictions threatened Camp operations. Then, in July 1942, James Petrillo, the new head of the American Federation of Musicians, forced NBC to cancel its broadcasts from Interlochen (after thirteen years), citing a threat to union jobs. While the Camp struggled with rationing, travel restrictions, and the virtual disappearance of college-age men, Maddy worked to remove the limitations on his own and the Camp broadcasts.,  His efforts were two-fold: (1) to develop an alternative radio network, which ultimately, he decided, should use the new FM technology, and (2) to secure national legislation prohibiting union interference with student performances. NBC's cancellation of his instructional program convinced him that educators needed to create their own broadcasting network. In the late 1930's and early 1940's, he began soliciting support for such a project from state officials and leading educators.,  By early 1944, with FM technology presenting a viable alternative, he secured the backing of President Ruthven to travel throughout southern Michigan in support of his proposal. His efforts led to the formation of the Michigan Educational Radio Association to plan FM broadcasting in the state, and in 1945, he became chairman of the new Michigan Community Radio Commission. Only the lack of sufficient state funding prevented the immediate implementation of his plan, which eventually led the University of Michigan to establish its own FM station (1948).,  While Maddy labored to create an educational network, he succeeded in restoring Camp performances to the airwaves on a limited basis. In 1943, Michigan State College's new station (initially, AM) and Traverse City's WCTM resumed broadcasting from the Camp. As with his instructional programs, he also experimented with recordings to widen his audience. Eventually, they replaced live performances for broadcast, especially on the growing numbers of FM educational stations.,  In attempting to secure legislation against Petrillo, Maddy relied heavily on former Camper father and friend, Senator Arthur Vandenberg. The issue was complicated by union efforts to secure compensation for recordings played on commercial radio. By January 1945, when Maddy appeared on the verge of success, Petrillo retaliated by putting the Camp on the American Federation of Musicians' ""Unfair List"", banning members from teaching or performing at Interlochen. A year later, shortly before Congress enacted relief legislation, Maddy was dismissed from the union for violating the ban.,  While the Lea Act (1946) forbade restrictions on noncommercial broadcasts, Petrillo, through legal wrangling and skillful use of the ""Unfair List,"" was able to circumvent it. In 1947, he reached a compromise with the leadership of the Music Educators National Conference. Under it, Petrillo waived all objections to performances by school groups, but by defining the Camp as a profit-making organization, he continued to limit its broadcasts. For over a decade, until Petrillo retired, the union ban remained in effect.,  Despite the limitation, the Camp prospered. Publicity about Petrillo's actions attracted both students and donors. During the height of the controversy, Camp enrollment doubled, and Maddy began obtaining significant financial contributions from business leaders. In 1944, retailer S.S. Kresge, Jr., made the first of several substantial gifts to the Camp. Other donors followed, often attracted by Maddy's stand against unionization or the Camp's principles of free competition.,  Although Maddy sought to end European dominance of American classical music, his success inevitably led him into international involvement. Early in 1940, he participated in the selection of a National Youth Administration orchestra to tour Latin America. Shortly thereafter, his old friend, Will Earhart, appointed him to the new State Department advisory committee on Inter-American Music. In his acceptance remarks, Maddy emphasized that music afforded the best means to overcome the language barrier. During the war, he encouraged Latin American music leaders to visit Interlochen and solicited support for their students as Campers. At the end of the conflict, he urged funding for a good will tour of Mexico by a high school orchestra.,  Like his friend Vandenberg, the war convinced Maddy of the need for international cooperation, and he became a supporter of the United Nations. In 1946, under his direction, the student council at Camp adopted a ""Charter for Youth,"" which set forth principles of world unity. Two years later, he dedicated Kresge Auditorium, the Camp's new performance center, ""to the promotion of World Friendship through the Universal Language of the Arts."",  When a mid-fifties thaw in the Cold War created opportunities for cultural exchange, Maddy lobbied the federal government for a Camp orchestra tour of Eastern Europe. Government, he argued, should aid groups of young amateurs, the world's future leaders, as it did the professionals. Having failed to secure federal assistance, he devoted the Camp's own resources to attracting foreign educators and students. Eventually, in 1964, he started the International (later World) Youth Symphony, composed of Campers from many nations, and two years later, arranged for the Camp to host the first meeting in America of the International Society of Music Educators.,  Maddy and the Camp emerged from World War II in excellent condition. While Maddy was secure at the university, the Camp was successful both financially and artistically. Because of the Camp's growing prosperity, Maddy was able to reduce his university appointment to part-time and devote even more of his energies to Interlochen's development.,  As the waiting list for Campers lengthened, he launched a vigorous program for new facilities and increased enrollment. In 1947, in order to better deal with the increased numbers, the Junior Division was split into Juniors (grades 3-6) and Intermediates (grades 7-9). Two years later, the All-State Piano Institute became the first of what were to be many post-camp programs for adults, and Maddy began to winterize new and existing buildings, so they could be used during colder weather. In the 1950's, loans from the University of Michigan helped considerably in Camp expansion.,  During the two decades following the war, the Camp grew from 155 buildings to 400, from 500 acres to 1,200, and from 900 Campers to 3,000. Although the union effectively barred professional musicians, music educators filled the void, and the Camp continued to produce first-rate alumni, who occupied leading positions with symphonies, opera and dance companies, and in other areas of contemporary life, both inside the arts and out.,  Amidst its growth, the Camp had to defeat threats from local boosters intent on developing the area economically. In 1953, Maddy thwarted a proposed state prison camp, and two years later, a federal air force base. The latter was vigorously promoted by Congresswoman Ruth Thompson of Whitehall, but Representatives Albert Engel of Lake City and Robert Griffin of Traverse City, both members of the Camp's Advisory Board, came to its defense.,  As the Camp grew, Maddy began to dream of making it a year-round institution for artistically talented youth. He envisioned a boarding high school and, eventually, a university that would provide training in both academic and artistic subjects. In planning the curriculum for the school, he relied heavily on Camp Advisory Board member, Martin ten Hoor, a former University of Michigan professor, now a dean at the University of Alabama.,  Nearing mandatory retirement from the university, Maddy initiated a major campaign to fulfill his dream. He added permanent staff, expanded facilities, and increased fund-raising efforts. On November 8, 1956, an alarmed Tremaine, in anticipation of his own imminent retirement as Camp Treasurer, wrote the Trustees a cautionary letter, based on his long experience with Camp finances. While he praised Maddy's vision and perseverance, he warned that Maddy's ambition needed to be restrained lest it put the institution in a precarious financial position as it had earlier.,  Despite Tremaine's admonition, Maddy proceeded with his expansion plans. Prior to 1956, the permanent staff consisted only of himself and a secretary (Peg Stace since 1941). He began the expansion by appointing Roger Jacobi as Camp Secretary and Director of Personnel (succeeded three years later by John A. Merrill). In 1957, he named George Wilson Vice President for Camp Operations, and in another year, Don Gillis, a composer and member of the musicians union, Director of Development. In part because of the Trustees' desire to groom a successor, Gillis received manifold responsibilities: to achieve a reconciliation with the new head of the musicians union, to direct the Camp's fledgling American Opera program, to oversee the Interlochen Press (which Maddy started in 1957 in hopes of generating income), to assist with expansion of the broadcast program, and perhaps most importantly, to aid in fund-raising.,  With Gillis' assistance, the dispute with the musicians union was quickly resolved, and in March 1959, the Camp was removed from its ""Unfair List."" Two years later, NBC broadcasts, now called ""The Best from Interlochen,"" resumed on tape. The same summer, Maddy scored a major coup by enticing the young international award-winning pianist, Van Cliburn, to make the first of several appearances at Interlochen. Fund-raising went far less well, and in March 1961, Gillis submitted his resignation. Still, Maddy remained committed to converting the Camp into a year-round institution for youthful artists.,  In the fall of 1961, having formally retired from the university, Maddy moved the Camp office, over the objections of the permanent staff from Ann Arbor to Interlochen. Shortly thereafter, Norma Lee Browning Ogg, a Chicago Tribune writer and Camp publicist, introduced Maddy to Chicago insurance executive and philanthropist Clement Stone. The two hit it off immediately, and Stone agreed to fund Maddy's long-planned boarding school for high school students, the Interlochen Arts Academy. Almost immediately, Stone was appointed to the Board of Trustees, on which he remained a leading force for nearly two decades (becoming its chair upon Roscoe Bonisteel's death in July 1972).,  Within another year (1962), Maddy and the institutions he founded experienced more major triumphs. Van Cliburn again made a special appearance at the Camp, and in August, its dancers and orchestra performed for President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy on the White House lawn. The next month, the Interlochen Arts Academy, a major component of Maddy's dream, opened.,  The following year (1963) witnessed additional achievements. The ""Today"" Show made a special telecast from Interlochen; the institution's new FM station, WIAA, went on the air, and the Browning biography of Maddy appeared. In another year, the University of Michigan awarded Maddy an honorary doctorate. At the commencement ceremony, his fellow honoree, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, announced plans for a ""Great Society."" Shortly thereafter, the President's daughter, Lucy Baines Johnson, appeared at Interlochen as narrator for the National Youth Symphony performance of Peter and the Wolf, which Van Cliburn conducted. The summer ended triumphantly with the first Interlochen Arts Festival, featuring the new World Youth Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra led by Eugene Ormandy.,  On April 18, 1966, as Interlochen prepared for the opening session of the International Society of Music Educators (whose participants included Norman Dello Joyo, Dimitri Kabalevsky, and Zoltan Kodaly), Joseph Maddy died suddenly. Until a successor could be chosen, the Board of Trustees appointed an Administrative Committee to oversee operations. Chaired by John Merrill (Secretary of the Board), its members included George Wilson (Director of the Camp), Thor Johnson (Director of the Academy), Clare Burns (Treasurer of Interlochen), and Margaret Stace (Maddy's long-time secretary, now Assistant to the President).,  Within a year, the Board selected national classical music broadcaster Karl Haas as Maddy's successor. Haas had worked with Maddy for several years as head of Interlochen's Advisory Board, which helped raise private funds. He also served as chair (with Maddy a member) of the Michigan Cultural Commission's music committee and the State Council for the Arts (created by Governor George Romney), which provided state assistance to Interlochen. In addition, the European born and educated Haas offered the strong international ties which Interlochen valued.,  As president, Haas announced his major goal would be to ""fulfill Joe Maddy's dreams,"" by securing funding for the proposed College of the Arts. To assist him, he named John Merrill Vice President for Administrative Affairs and Development. In 1968, a new institutional name, ""The Interlochen Center for the Arts,"" was adopted to cover the Camp, Academy, and proposed college.,  Despite great efforts, fund raising failed to fulfill expectations. The relationship between the Camp and Academy remained strained, and some Board members grew dissatisfied with student behavior (particularly at the Academy, where the new youth culture took hold). Changing tastes in music, especially among the young, and in family vacation patterns as well as the development of competing institutions, such as the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp in Michigan (which opened the summer following Maddy's death), threatened Interlochen's unchallenged preeminence. In November 1969, Merrill announced his acceptance of a development position at Northwestern University, and four months later, after a board meeting at which he outlined his proposals for Interlochen's future, Haas submitted his resignation.,  Until a permanent head could be chosen, George Wilson, who was nearing retirement as Camp director, agreed to serve as Interim President. A year later (1971), the Board named music educator and long-time Interlochen administrator and instructor Roger Jacobi to head the institution. Following his resignation in 1959 as Board secretary, Jacobi continued to teach summers at the Camp while holding a joint appointment with the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor public schools, much as Maddy once did. Then, in 1968, Jacobi became Assistant Dean of the Music School, in which capacity he served as Director of the Camp's University Division (Allen Britton and Paul Boylan, who held the post earlier and later, eventually became Deans of the Music School).,  During Jacobi's eighteen year presidency, he defused tensions inherent in the transition from the Maddy era and put the institution on a solid financial basis. Physical facilities were significantly improved, and for the first time, a major endowment was established. Interlochen continued to attract leading artists and to produce high quality graduates. It also served as the model (with George Wilson's assistance) for a similar music camp in the Philippines, and in 1975, hosted a visit by President and Mrs. Gerald Ford. On the eve of Jacobi's retirement, he discontinued (after the 1988 season) the University Division, an important tie to the University of Michigan for thirty-seven years.,  Jacobi's advance announcement of his intention to retire at age sixty-five gave the Trustees ample time to prepare for an orderly transition. In 1989, they chose Dean Boal, a distinguished college-level teacher and administrator and public broadcasting executive, to became the first Interlochen president who neither knew nor worked with Maddy. Prior to coming for his selection interview, Boal had only visited Interlochen once, and then, just briefly.,  Shortly after his appointment (1989), the National Music Camp was renamed ""the Interlochen Arts Camp,"" reflecting its incorporation into the larger institution and expansion beyond music. Despite a recession-induced cut in state funding, Boal kept the operation financially sound and oversaw the growth of the Academy and Camp to record enrollments. He also increased the scope of summer professional offerings, which attracted growing numbers of outsiders to the Camp. Like all of Maddy's successors, he faced the tensions inherent in trying to balance needed changes with valued traditions.,  Early in 1994, Boal announced his intention of taking early retirement as soon as a successor could be chosen. A year later, the trustees named youth educator Richard F. Odell, headmaster of the Chicago Academy for the Arts, to lead Interlochen into the twenty-first century. Like Boal, Odell lacked previous association with Maddy and the institution he founded.,  On becoming president, Odell spent much of his first year meeting with Interlochen supporters both on campus and throughout the country in order to define the institution's future goals. Then, he announced a major fund-raising program to renovate facilities and increase endowment, adding that he hoped to make Interochen better known both in its home area and beyond. In fact, during Odell's tenure, the camp was named one of the top ten camps in the country and the World Youth Symphony Orchestra performed in the Cultural Olympiad at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, GA.,  Odell was succeeded by Edward J. Downing. During Downing's time in office, Interlochen merged with The Pathfinder School, a local independent day school for pre-school through eighth-grade students. Downing retired in 2002 and was succeeded by Jeffery S. Kimpton in 2003.",

(Charles Wesley), 1919-","Huron High School (Ann Arbor, Mich.), Huron High School (Ann Arbor, Mich.)","Charles Wesley Lane was born in 1919. He began his career as an architect by working at construction sites during his summer breaks from the University of Michigan, from 1937 through 1941. He then worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the MacArthur Lock in Sault St. Marie. Following Lane's graduation from the University of Michigan he served in World War II. He was in Louisiana for a short time, helping to supervise construction of a blimp hangar. He then began work as a Photo Interpretation officer and was part of the landing at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He also spent some time in Nagasaki after the atomic bomb. Upon returning he went to work as an architect for George Brigham in Ann Arbor. Brigham's office was divided into two areas, research and production. Lane was assigned to work in research as an architect for Brigham's Progressive Homes Corporation (PHC). The goal of PHC was to design a completely prefabricated home that could be erected in eight hours (with the footings already in place) for the price of $1500. Brigham began the company with funders that included Eugene Cassaroll of Dual Motors. Lane describes the other investors as ""auto people from Detroit."" The investors disassociated Brigham from the research division when his pace of development did not move along as quickly as they had hoped. The head of PHC was Ira E. ""Mickey"" Gillen, a former production manager for Chrysler Motors.,  Gillen and the investors acquired 100,000 square feet of space in Pine Bluff, Arkansas to manufacture their homes. Gillen arranged for the building supplies to come from a variety of companies across the U.S. In a reflection of Gillen's automotive background, he wanted the pieces of the houses brought to Arkansas and assembled as pieces of a car are brought to a central location to be assembled. Gillen set up dealerships for the houses in every state and in England, France and South America. In South America he had a contract for 10,000 homes and in California a naval station wanted 5,000 houses, if they were financed by the Federal Housing Administration. The first two manufactured homes were built in Indiana, then Wisconsin. At about the fifth or sixth house, the local authorities would not issue a building permit because the local plumbers union was against the use of stamped steel in the building. Gillen had the support of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) over the plumbers, but the FHA still would not finance the homes. This was the end of the company because no one would finance the building of the houses. Since 1947, 400 homes had come off of the assembly line. Those homes were built around Washington D.C. because of a contract the PHC had with the government, which the latter was forced to honor. By 1948, about 250 similar companies producing manufactured homes had sprung up around the United States.,  After the failure of PHC, Lane went to work for the Walter Aneche firm in Ann Arbor; he worked at the firm from 1948 to 1952. Lane designed drawings for Good Housekeeping and schools in Michigan. In 1952 Lane established his own firm in Ann Arbor with architects Alex Riebe and Keith Weiland. Lane developed a 24 x 36 steel sheet that was repetitive and was used in about 400 schools in Michigan. Lane designed many schools and residences throughout Michigan with his firm. The firm was hired in the 1960s to design Huron High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This was the largest, most unique school that he designed. He originally made 17 designs of the building, all which were rectangular in shape. In an effort to save money he created a circular design that reduced corridor space and cost. Lane was lauded for the unique design and budget reducing measures. In addition to the actual structure, Lane also made recommendations, which were followed, on where Huron Parkway should be placed.,  In 1971, shortly after the completion of Huron High School, Lane left his firm to pursue his interest in manufactured housing. Alex Riebe moved the firm to Farmington, Michigan. Lane saw that many of the same obstacles remained, with the exception of the invention of the mobile home park. In the late 1960s Lane designed a mobile home park in Almont, Michigan which was unique because it had paved streets, parking, and landscaping.",

He worked briefly as a line worker at a Ford tractor factory when he was 19 years old and went on to attend Swarthmore College. As a student, Levin was actively involved in student groups including serving on the student council, the American Student Government Movement, and Students for Democratic Action (SDA). In 1956, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science and went on to attend Harvard Law School. Levin continued his student activism with SDA at Harvard and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1959. Upon graduation, Levin returned to Michigan and worked as an attorney at Grossman, Human and Gossman from 1959 to 1964, and taught law at the University of Detroit Mercy and Wayne State University., In 1961, Carl Levin married Barbara Halpern, who holds a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Michigan, a Master of Arts in mathematics from Colombia University, and a Bachelor of Laws from Wayne State University (1977).

Butterfield was born in Bay City, Michigan on January 30, 1915, the son of George E. Butterfield, a Bay City educator, and Esther Butterfield. He was the valedictorian of Bay City High School's graduating class of 1933. After attending Bay City Junior College, he transferred over to the University of Michigan in 1935. Working on a combined course program in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts and the Law School, Butterfield received his B.A. in 1937 and his law degree in 1940.,  Returning to Bay City after his graduation, he served as an assistant to the City Attorney and then in 1942 left to serve as a Law Clerk to the Michigan Supreme Court. In 1944 he was inducted into the infantry and commissioned in 1945. On July 5, 1945 he married the former Eleanor Meyers, and they eventually had two children, Miriam and Robert. He continued his career in the Army by serving in the Judge Advocate General's Department in 1946 while stationed in the Philippines. After the war he returned once again to Bay City and entered private practice.,  Ira Butterfield was very active in politics. In 1956 he was elected County Prosecuting Attorney for Bay County, a position which he held for two years, from 1957 to 1958. After an unsuccessful bid for reelection he once again returned to private practice. In 1968 Butterfield was elected to the newly created position of District Judge in the 74th District Court. He served from January 1, 1969 until 1978 when he resigned to accept Governor Milliken's appointment as circuit court judge for the 18th Judicial Circuit. He served here until his term expired January 1, 1981.,  Throughout his career Butterfield was active in a variety of professional organizations, including the following: Bay County Bar Association (Treasurer 1943, Vice President 1953, President 1954), and as a member of the State Bar of Michigan, the American Judicature Society, and the American Bar Association. Ira Butterfield also served his community in a variety of volunteer organizational activities, including: the Bay County Council on Juvenile Delinquency (President 1947-49); Bay County Historical Society (President and Treasurer); Michigan Archaeological Society (State President 1956-57); and Gubernatorial Recount Board, Bay County (1950 and 1952).,  Ira Butterfield was very interested in the First Congregational Church of Bay City. Along with his father, George Butterfield, Ira Butterfield served the church in various capacities, as moderator, clerk, Sunday school superintendent, chairman of the trustees, and chairman of the deacons.,  Of considerable interest to Butterfield while he was associated with the church was the rift that developed in the 1950s between the minister and members of the congregation. The Reverend Thomas Vernon became minister of the church in 1947, and by the early 1950s disagreement had developed between him and one section of the congregation (which included the Butterfield family) over his theology. This group felt that the minister was forcing out longtime members who disagreed with his views, and ""packing"" the membership with his own supporters. The minister, in return, charged that the dissenters were traditionalists who were intolerant of any beliefs other than their own.,  The controversy escalated throughout the 1950s. The dissenting group accused the minister and his supporters of altering records and manipulating the church constitution, church membership, and church organizations in order to move the church away from congregationalism. The minister charged that the dissenting group represented a minority which would use any means to get rid of him because of his liberal views, and insisted that his actions were true to the spirit of congregationalism. The move on the national level during the late 1950s to merge the Congregational and Evangelical and Reformed denominations into the United Church of Christ added further complexity to the situation, with the minister siding with those who wanted to remain more strictly congregational.,  Despite the protests, in 1957 the congregation voted to retain Rev. Vernon as minister. Eventually, the dissenting group ceased to participate in church activities, organized itself into the Christian Congregational Association, hired a lawyer, and moved to call an Ecclesiastical Council of the Central Association of Congregational Christian Churches of Michigan. They petitioned to have the church declared extinct as a congregational church, and if successful, their goal was to proceed to civil courts to have the corporation dissolved and to regain control of the church property.,  The Ecclesiastical Council was held on November 13, 1957, and in December it denied the petition to declare the church extinct. The report of the Ecclesiastical Council concluded that each side had some basis for its charges, and sharply criticized the behavior of both parties. The Council recommended that Rev. Vernon resign within one year, and in 1959, Rev. Vernon and some former members of the First Congregational Church founded the First Unitarian Church of Bay City.,  After the controversy, the Butterfield family again became active in church affairs, attempting to reverse a steady decline in membership. By 1985 the First Congregational Church was sharing a minister with the First United Church of Christ of Bay City and consideration was being given to a merger of the two churches. The First Congregational Church decided against this option, however, and continued to operate separately.,  Ira Butterfield died in 1995.",

The Bulletin was expanded in a more comprehensive journal in 1941 and renamed The Far Eastern Quarterly. This publication was supported by a small committee of scholars who had organized themselves as the Far Eastern Association.,  Because of continued financial difficulties, a special meeting was held in 1948 and the committee, along with some invited guests, discussed the possibility of reorganizing the Association as an active membership organization. The first meeting of the reorganized Association was held in New York City on April 2, 1948. Arthur W. Hummell of the Library of Congress was elected the Association's first president.,  The objectives of the Association were:, In December 1949 the board of directors decided to seek new sources of revenue to expand the organization's scope. The board prioritized the purposes of these funds as:, Initial funding was achieved by raising membership dues, however the Research Committee on Development of Far Eastern Studies was created for the purpose of exploring foundation support for these activities. By the end of 1955 the Committee's work led to substantial funding for the Association through the Ford Foundation. Ford Foundation's support was generous; subsidizing the expansion of the society's journal, the establishment of a monograph series, the publication of a newsletter, the maintenance of a secretariat, and the work of various Association committees. By 1960 outside funding had made possible an increased level of activity and stability within the Association.,  In 1956 the Far Eastern Association was renamed the Association for Asian Studies (AAS), the Far Eastern Quarterly was re-titled the Journal of Asian Studies, and the constitution and bylaws were amended to incorporate south Asia into the sphere of the Association's interest and activity. To reflect this latter change the Association's board of directors was expanded from nine to twelve members, with three seats on the board reserved for south Asian specialists.,  Membership growth and the expanded geographic interest of the Association led to the formation of areas study committees in the mid-1950's. The first to be well established was the Committee on South Asia, which in 1956 received a large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, enabling it to sponsor a number of organizational meetings of South Asian specialists. Broad umbrella committees such as the Committee on South Asia were further subdivided by the development of even more specialized committees, such as the Ceylon Studies Committee, the Bengal Studies Committee, the Gandhi Centennial Committee, and the Ghalib Centenary Committee, all of which sponsored their own conferences, lectures and publications. The pattern established by the South Asian Committee was replicated in other parts of the Association. In 1962, for example, the Committee on Southeast Asia was established. It quickly developed subcommittees such as the Burma Study Group, the Language Resources Committee, and the Indonesia Studies Committee. By 1969-1970 two other broad groups, representing scholarly interest in Northeast Asia and China and Inner Asia had been formed. They, and their predecessors in the fields of Southeast Asia and South Asia, were formally recognized in 1969/70 by the designation ""Regional Councils"".,  The link between the AAS and the University of Michigan is rooted in the strong bonds of service that grew between UM faculty members interested in Asian Studies and the Association. Beginning in 1952 a succession of UM faculty served in the AAS secretariat. In 1955 the Association's board of director's voted to establish a permanent Secretariat and locate it in Ann Arbor.",

The AIJLS was created by the United States War Department in order to build an elite corps of Japanese-speaking officers, who were to do intelligence work and provide support for combat troops. The school was an intensive course, consisting of intensive Japanese language and culture classes, as well as military drills, inspections, and typical army exercises characteristic of U.S. military training camps.,  Goodman's class (Company A, 3651st Service Unit), graduated from AIJLS on January 4, 1944, and continued on to complete further training at the Military Intelligence Service Language School in Minnesota (MISLS).

28,umich-bhl-93291,Amateur photographer; sixty-two reels of film shot by Benz on various trips.,The material is in English,"When the University of Michigan Media Resources Collection was accessioned by the Bentley Historical Library, a number of films were discovered in the vault that were not related to that collection. Within that material were travel films shot by Fred E. Benz. These films document Benz's travels around the world between 1929 and 1950. The films had been edited together and were probably used by Benz for presentation to local groups and as home entertainment.,  The Fred E. Benz Collection contains sixty-two, 400 foot reels of silent 16mm film. It is made up of eight series, one for each trip taken. The series are: Africa, Australia/New Zealand, Guatemala, Havana, Mexico, Russia, South America, and a World Cruise. 
 
 The contents of each reel are described in the finding aid. Benz has included handwritten descriptions of the images found on the Russian and World Cruise series attached to the inside lids of each can of film. Benz was careful to document most of the locations with a handwritten note displayed before the camera. When cities or natural markers are noted in the finding aid, the identifying information was taken from that supplied by the film maker on the screen or from his notes in the can lids. The spelling of geographic locations in the finding aid reflect the information on the film and not current spellings.,  Short notes found with the Mexican footage indicate it was the result of two different trips. The reels retain their original numbering because the numbered reels (1,2,3,4) appear to comprise one trip and numbered/lettered reels (1a, 3a, 4a) comprise the second trip.,  The value of the collection is that it captures moments in time, documenting lifestyles, architecture and modes of travel which no longer exist or have evolved over time. Footage exists of London on the eve of war and Shanghai one year before being destroyed by the Japanese invasion.,  Perhaps the greater value lies in the depiction of the indigenous lifestyles captured on film. Benz, as an amateur photographer, was interested in the common events that he experienced as he traveled. The collection features extensive recordings of people working or playing, and children of different cultures going about their daily activities. The films show barren huts in remote areas of Russia in the 1930s, families living under stone bridges outside of Buenos Aires, life-saving competitions in Sydney and the plethora of street markets found in most cultures and countries that he traveled through.,  Because these are travel films, the scope of the footage included often extends beyond the geographic area used to identify the series. For example, the Australia footage includes material filmed on various Pacific islands, the Asian continent and Japan. The Russian trip contains footage of England and Northern Europe, and the South American films contain shots of the departure from New York. Each series should be examined for additional geographic content.,  Special attention should be given to the Mexican series containing film recordings of Mt. Rushmore with construction only partially complete. Included as well are extensive shots of bullfighting in addition to other Mexican scenes. Also of note is the extensive depiction of women throughout all of the series. On the canister containing reel 5 in the Russia series is a receipt from United States Navy Department stating that this reel was being forwarded to Chicago for study of the shots of Kirkenes, Norway.,  The color in the Africa, Guatemala, Havana, Mexico and South America series is excellent. The wide, clean, lush cityscapes of Havana and Capetown are richly captured in color and give an indication why they were popular travel destinations at this time.,  In addition to the eight travel series, the collection also included one reel of World War II footage assembled by Castle Films from public domain footage. This type of film was sold through camera stores and mail order houses and Benz probably purchased a reel for his own use.

Fred retained an interest in the business but relinquished the operation of Benz Brothers to Albert and became the treasurer of the Ann Arbor Finance Company in 1928. In 1931, he left that position and became vice-president and secretary of The National Company of Ann Arbor. He retired in 1932 but retained his interest in the Benz Brothers operation. Very little additional information exists relating to Benz. He married in 1916 to a woman named Margaret and the marriage lasted until his death in 1963.

From 1910 to 1912, while a student, Hayden was an assistant in American history at the University of Michigan. In 1912, he became a member of the university's department of political science, where he remained, except for his service with the government, until his death on May 19, 1945.,  During World War I, Hayden was a lieutenant in the Michigan Naval Militia serving as senior officer of the University of Michigan division. He was in active service from April 1917 to February 1919. Following the war, Hayden returned to the University of Michigan.,  Hayden was a recognized authority on the Philippine Islands. In this, Hayden was carrying on a tradition begun by Dean C. Worcester, who, like Hayden, was both on the faculty of the University of Michigan and called to public service in the Philippine Islands because of his expertise and experience. In 1922-23, Hayden was an exchange professor at the University of the Philippines; in 1930-31, he was the Carnegie Visiting Professor in the State University of the Philippines. In 1922-23, 1926, and 1930-31, Hayden was special correspondent in the Far East for the Christian Science Monitor. Hayden used each of these opportunities to travel in the islands, to study, and to make contacts with Philippine citizens, both government officials and private citizens.,  In recognition of his learning and wide experience in Philippine matters, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Hayden to serve as vice governor of the Philippines and secretary of public instruction. His choice for governor general, Frank Murphy, though possessing administrative skills and political charm, was coming to the Philippines without any real knowledge of the actualities of Filipino life and custom, and thus Roosevelt's reasoning for pairing Hayden with the former Detroit mayor. Hayden responded admirably to his selection by the president, performing his duties efficiently, even serving as acting governor general when Murphy returned to the United States for a six-month period.,  With the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, Hayden returned to the University of Michigan, where he taught and worked on what would be his classic work The Philippines: A study in national development (1941). Following his return, Hayden was named James Orin Murfin Professor of Political Science and chairman of the department.,  Hayden returned to public service with the outbreak of World War II, where his knowledge of the Philippines proved invaluable. From 1941 to 1945, he worked with the U.S. Office of the Coordinator of Information and, after June 1942, with its successor organization, the Office of Strategic Services. From 1943 to 1945, Hayden was named civil adviser and consultant on Philippine affairs with the U.S. War Department, attached to the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. As part of this later activity, Hayden developed and headed up as chief a special staff section of the United States Armed Forces for the Far East - the Philippine Research and Information Section. The role he envisioned for the Philippine Research and Information Section was three-fold: to prepare reports and studies about the Philippines; to distribute information about the Philippines as needed; and to collect books, magazines, newspapers, and printed and manuscript materials about the Philippines with a view to their ""effectiveness in furthering the prosecution of the war.""",

Babst was a nationally known lawyer, industrialist, and businessman, who maintained throughout his life a deep and abiding affection for his alma mater, the University of Michigan. Born July 6, 1870, in Crestline, Ohio, Babst attended Kenyon College, then transferred to the University of Michigan where he received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1893 and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1894.,  Upon graduation, Babst practiced law in Detroit where he also became counsel and associate editor (1894-1902) of The Michigan Farmer, a widely circulated and influential weekly paper. During the 1896 election, he served as secretary of the Michigan Sound Money League, an anti-Bryan, anti-Free Silver organization of businessmen. Two years later, in 1898, he became secretary of the Citizens Committee on Education which initiated a plan for the administration of the public schools of Detroit.,  Also in 1898, Babst's career took a new direction when he went to Chicago on a case involving the National Biscuit Company, one of the nation's major food companies that was attempting to market its products in packages identified by national trademarks and promoted by national advertising. Before this time, most food products were sold in bulk containers. The changeover to identifiable packaging involved long and tedious patent and trademark litigation, because each state had its own laws restricting corporations in others states from doing business in their region. Babst was influential in removing these barriers and opening the way for uniformity in the laws regulating the food industry.,  In 1902, Babst moved to Chicago with his own law firm - Green, Peters and Babst. In 1906, he went to New York as general counsel and vice president of the National Biscuit Company. In 1915, Babst became president of the American Sugar Refining Company. Here, Babst was primarily responsible for revolutionizing the marketing and packaging of sugar. Until then, sugar was sold to brokers who distributed it to wholesalers and retailers, packed in bags or barrels, and then sold to consumers in paper bags. Upon firsthand investigation, Babst believed the traditional method to be both wasteful and unsanitary. The most efficient and sanitary way to distribute sugar, he felt, was to market it in sealed cartons that would insure full weight and leave it untouched by any hands other than the consumer's.,  Although not unchallenged, Babst's viewpoint became established and Babst became a respected voice in New York and Wall Street business circles. During World War I, he represented the United States as a member of the International Sugar Committee that, in cooperation with the United States Food Administration, worked to allocate sugar supplies to the Allies. In 1925, Babst became chairman of the American Sugar Refining Company and its chief executive officer. He served as CEO until 1937, and was chairman until his retirement in 1951. During his career Babst was also director of various New York banks and financial institutions.,  During the later part of his life, Babst turned much of his energies to his lifelong love of the University of Michigan. Long active in Alumni Association affairs, Babst had a keen interest in University of Michigan history. As sponsor of the Michigan Historical Collections of the University of Michigan, Babst suggested that a study be conducted of the contributions made during the presidency of Grover Cleveland by U-M alumni and former students. The result was the publication in 1948 of Michigan and the Cleveland Era a book jointly edited by Babst and Collections director Lewis G. Vander Velde.,  Earl D. Babst died April 23, 1967 at age 96. In 1903, he had married Alice Edwina Uhl, daughter of Edwin F. Uhl, assistant secretary of state and ambassador to Germany, 1893-1896. Babst was survived by two daughters, Mrs. George H.

Kahn pioneered the use of reinforced concrete, non-intrusive steel structures, natural ventilation and glass building skins to respond to the changing functional needs of the American factory. His pragmatism, ability to listen to the needs of the client and experimentation with innovative building technologies resulted in a new industrial architecture, which inspired the development of European Modernism by Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier. Hugely versatile in his design capabilities and strongly interested in historic architecture, Kahn also produced many commercial and institutional icons in Detroit and at the University of Michigan, including the Fisher Building, Detroit Athletic Club, General Motors Building, Hill Auditorium, Angell Hall, William L. Clements Library and Burton Memorial Carillon Tower. This most prolific of American architects built over 2000 projects in his lifetime, including 521 factories in Russia between 1929 and 1932, and in 1938 was constructing 19% of all architect-designed industrial facilities in the United States. When he died in 1942, he had signed defense contracts totaling $200 million for the construction of the Willow Run Bomber Plant and naval bases in Honolulu, Midway Island, Puerto Rico and Kodiak, Alaska, among other war-time facilities.,  Born on March 21, 1869 in Rhaunen, Germany, Kahn spent much of his childhood in Echternach, Luxembourg. His father Joseph, an itinerant teacher and rabbi, came to the United States in 1879. Joseph's wife Rosalie and six of their children joined him in 1880 and lived in Baltimore, Maryland for a short time before settling in Detroit. Albert was the oldest of eight children in the Kahn family and showed brilliance as a pianist at an early age. Due to the family's economic hardship, Rosalie advised him to take up a more practical line of work, although she arranged for him to take drawing lessons from the German sculptor Julius Melchers. Kahn completed his formal education after the seventh grade, when he left school to supplement the family's income with odd jobs, including the position of office boy at the architectural firm of John Scott. At the dedication of George Mason's Masonic Temple years later in 1923, Kahn showed his sense of humor when he told the story of being fired from this first job in architecture. To increase his meager income, he worked in a stable before leaving for the office every morning and would arrive at the firm smelling like the horses. He surmised that ""most of the men had a very keen sense of smell and I literally got on their olfactory nerves."" [1],  After this employment failure, Melchers referred Kahn to the Detroit architectural firm of Mason and Rice in 1885. Here the 26-year-old George Mason recognized his brilliance and promoted him from the position of office boy to draftsman, despite his color vision deficiency. Years later, Kahn expressed his gratitude to Mason for his tutelage, recalling that he and the other apprentices admired George's ""indomitable energy, his enthusiasm, his nice criticisms, his general helpfulness, his keen interest in us, his innate ability and his own superior draftsmanship.""[2] In 1887, Mason assigned Kahn the job of laying out the famous 660-foot-long porch of the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island Over the ten years that he remained with Mason and Rice, Kahn worked on numerous commissions, including designs for Hiram Walker in Windsor, Ontario.,  While working for Mason and Rice in 1891 at the age of 22, Kahn won a $500 travel scholarship, awarded by American Architect and Building News, to study in Europe for a year. He met Henry Bacon, Jr. in Florence and traveled for four months through Italy, France, Belgium and Germany with this young architect, who would later design the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Years later, Kahn said of Bacon, ""to me he proved not only a splendid teacher but a real friend whose kindness and stimulating influence I have treasured ever since."" [3] It was during this period of educational travel that Kahn developed his love of Palladio and a wide range of historic architectural styles which inspired many of his own later residential, commercial and institutional designs. When he returned from Europe, Kahn was promoted by Mason to chief designer, and in 1892, he turned down a job offer from Adler and Sullivan to fill the position of Frank Lloyd Wright, who had just been fired from the Chicago firm.,  In 1896, Kahn married Ernestine Krolik, the daughter of a successful dry goods merchant who was a client of the young architect. A graduate of the University of Michigan, Ernestine was a talented gardener and interior designer, who often advised Albert on matters of color and fabric selection. When speaking of her parents, their daughter Rosalie Kahn Butzel said years later that ""they complemented each other wonderfully."" [4] Albert and Ernestine had two other daughters, Lydia and Ruth, and one son, Edgar. ""Eddie"" became the first scorer and captain of the University of Michigan hockey team and, from 1949 to 1971, served as the innovative chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Michigan Hospital (designed by his father in 1919).,  Kahn left Mason and Rice in 1895 to found Nettleton, Kahn and Trowbridge with two of his colleagues from Mason's office. The new firm was known for its design of Children's Hospital on St. Antoine Street, financed by Hiram Walker in 1896. When Alexander B. Trowbridge left Detroit to become dean of the College of Architecture at Cornell University in 1877, the firm was renamed Nettleton and Kahn, until George W. Nettleton died in 1900. Kahn then joined with George Mason briefly, producing the Palms Apartments (1901-1902) on Jefferson Avenue and the initial design for the Pantheon-inspired Temple Beth El (1902) on Woodward Avenue. The Palms project represented Kahn's earliest experimentation with reinforced concrete structures, which would soon revolutionize his design of American factories.,  By 1903, Kahn had joined with a talented designer to form the firm of Albert Kahn, Architect, Ernest Wilby, Associate. Wilby practiced with Kahn until 1918 and made a major contribution to the innovative designs of the Ford Motor Company Highland Park Plant in Dearborn (1908-09) and Hill Auditorium (1913) and the Natural Science Building (1917) at the University of Michigan. 1903 was also the year that Kahn's brother Julius became chief engineer of the firm and began his ground-breaking collaboration with Albert on the use of reinforced concrete in industrial design, which would have global impact. Albert had helped educate Julius, who received his B.S. and C.E. degrees at the University of Michigan. Having served as an engineer for the U.S. Navy and the U. S. Engineering Corps from 1896 to 1903, Julius brought technical expertise in structural design to the firm. Thus began Albert's revolutionary practice of joining the multiple disciplines of architecture and engineering under one professional roof, just as he would incorporate multi-functional operations into his subsequent designs of assembly-line factories.,  Kahn's first factory built of reinforced concrete in Detroit was Building Number 10 for the Packard Motor Company (1905). In 1903, Henry Joy had commissioned Kahn to design an automobile plant on 40 acres on East Grand Boulevard. The first nine buildings which Kahn produced on the site were of conventional, nineteenth-century, timber construction, which caused mills to be prone to fire and impeded production because of the need for numerous structural posts. After experimenting with and perfecting his ""Kahn system"" [5] of reinforced concrete in the University of Michigan Engineering Building (1903), Julius collaborated with Albert on the structural design of the two-story Packard Building No. 10 using this innovative technology. The Kahn system soon revolutionized the design of factories nation-wide because reinforced concrete buildings were more fire-proof, vibration from large machinery was minimized, assembly floors could be more open and flexible through the use of fewer columns and larger double-hung window openings permitted more natural light and ventilation for workers. Packard Building Number 10 was so technologically advanced that it attracted the attention of tourists, who flocked to the site, and, most importantly, Henry Ford.,  Ford approached Kahn in 1908 to build an automobile plant for the manufacture of his Model T automobiles on a new 180-acre site in Highland Park, when it appeared that his first two factories were becoming obsolete. Thus began a long-term partnership between two geniuses: Ford, who foresaw the futuristic advantages of assembly-line production, and Kahn, who ""found aesthetic values in the forms engendered by new techniques and functional considerations."" [6] In implementing Ford's vision over the next 34 years of their collaboration, Kahn completed over 1,000 projects for the Ford Motor Company, with the ""Crystal Palace"" [7] at Highland Park being perhaps his most famous.,  The Highland Park main assembly building (1910), with the first mechanized assembly line, was a four-story, concrete structure, 840 feet long. Through the use of imported steel-frame, floor-to-ceiling sash, Kahn further improved the health and safety conditions of the American factory. Over the next five years, Kahn added a 5-smokestack power house, an administration building with a frieze of glazed tiles, other assembly buildings and steel-framed atriums between the structures. Gravity conveyances and overhead, traveling cranes in the atriums moved raw materials down the four levels of the plant to the final assembly-line area on the first floor, where 700,000 Tin Lizzies would be produced by the year 1917. In its stunning simplicity, its innovative use of steel, brick and glass and its new aesthetic principle of form following function, the Crystal Palace is thought to have inspired the work of Walter Gropius in his 1914 Faguswerk [8] and influenced the development of European Modernism.,  When the Highland Park automobile operation outgrew its site, Henry Ford purchased 2000 acres on the River Rouge in 1917 and commissioned Kahn to design and construct what would become the largest manufacturing complex in the world. The design of the River Rouge plant cemented his reputation as the father of American industrial architecture. In the first assembly Building B, where Ford produced the Eagle Submarine Chaser for the U. S. Navy, the continuous moveable assembly line was further perfected in a one-half-mile-long, one-story, steel structure, which was economically and quickly built for the World War I military operation. Here the first steel, saw-tooth roof and glass and steel sash cladding were to become the hallmarks of Kahn's innovative industrial work.,  Although Kahn expanded the Ford Motor Company Rouge River plant with more buildings to house the cement, motor assembly, open hearth and pressed steel operations in the early 1920s, his 1922 Glass Plant on the site was ""the building of greatest significance, both in terms of Kahn's career and in the larger history of industrial architecture."" [9] The steel cage construction, saw-tooth roof and glass curtain walls, while breathtakingly minimalist on the exterior, provided the flexibility and open space to perfectly accommodate the manufacturing processes on the interior. This architectural icon within the most renown industrial site in the world changed the form and function of American industrial architecture at home and abroad and inspired the work of other architects, engineers and artists.,  Kahn certainly recognized the aesthetic values in his ""beautiful factories,"" [10] as he called them, although he would not have had the historical perspective at the time to understand the impact of his designs on the emerging Modern movement. In his characteristically solution-oriented way of thinking, he expressed his views on industrial architecture in a 1940 speech to the New York Society of Architects: The simpler the exterior the better it is, as a rule, for are we not quite agreed that a straight forward and direct expression of the function of the structure is an important element in all architecture, even the purely monumental; that proper proportions, effective grouping and good outline may be produced at no increase in cost; that these are infinitely more desirable than elaborate ornamentation, no matter how well executed. [11],  As a result of his breakthrough industrial work for Ford, Kahn received commissions to construct 150 major buildings for General Motors Corporation and many for Chrysler. He also produced manufacturing facilities for companies which were turning out clothing, textiles, food, cement and other products. His reputation for building efficient plants on-time and under-budget caused his office to grow to 400 staff members by 1920 and to bring in more than $1,000,000 of work a week. By 1939, Kahn's office, with a staff of 600, was constructing 19% of all architect-designed industrial facilities in the United States, his Chrysler Dodge Half-Ton Truck Plant (1938) in Warren, Michigan, being among the best known. Mies van der Rohe was inspired by Kahn's Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft assembly building (1937), with its 135,000-square-foot, column-free work area, spanned by the longest, flat-roof trusses ever used in a building.,  By 1929, the famed collaboration of Henry Ford and Albert Kahn on the River Rouge Plant had come to the attention of the Russians, who admired their efficient accommodation of industrial design to the principles of mass production. Representatives of the Amtorg Trading Corporation came to Detroit to propose that Kahn become the consulting architect to the Soviet Union in the initiation of Stalin's First Five-Year Plan to industrialize his nation. Between 1929 and 1932, with Kahn's brother Moritz at the helm of the his Moscow architectural/engineering office, the firm produced 521 tractor, steel, auto, airplane and chemical plants for $2 billion, the largest architectural design project in the firm's history. [12] Twenty-five professionals from the Detroit firm set up the Moscow office and trained over 4,000 Soviet engineers, architects and other personnel. The tractor factories at Stalingrad and Cheliabinsk were two of the largest plants built under Kahn's supervision. The Stalingrad plant, designed with a 1300-foot-long assembly area to produce 40,000 tractors a year, was constructed in a record six months. The factory was later the site of the pivotal battle of Stalingrad, where the Russians were victorious over the Germans and turned the tide of World War II.,  One of the reasons for Kahn's world-wide reputation in industrial architecture was his ground-breaking establishment of a non-traditional, multi-disciplinary firm of designers, mechanical and structural engineers, cost accountants and job managers, who could provide the full range of design/build functions in-house. Through this collaboration of professionals within one firm, Kahn could make construction more efficient and less costly for clients. He had raised factory design to a legitimate level of architectural practice and years later would recall:,  When I began, the real architects would design only museums, cathedrals, capitols, monuments. The office boy was considered good enough to do factory buildings. I'm still that office boy designing factories. I have no dignity to be impaired. [13],  The final chapter in Kahn's industrial architecture career focuses on his contributions to America's ""Arsenal of Democracy"" [14] during World War II. Between 1914 and 1917, Kahn had constructed the first hangar building ever built at Langley Field, the Ford Eagle Shipbuilding Factory at River Rouge and the majority of the country's World War I naval bases and army airfields. In the last three years of his life, his firm took on the bulk of the U. S. Defense Department's contracts for World War II, totaling $200 million. These included naval bases in Alaska, Hawaii, Midway Island, Puerto Rico and Jacksonville, Florida. Kahn also constructed the Chrysler Tank Arsenal (1941) and numerous airplane factories, the largest of which was the 70-acre Ford Motor Company Willow Run Bomber factory (1943) at Ypsilanti, Michigan. Willow Run was Kahn's last industrial project for Ford. The B-24 Liberator bomber was produced here in a 4,000,000-square-foot, artificially lighted assembly plant to guard against the threat of night attack. This was the world's largest industrial facility, producing one bomber every 24 hours. In 1942, just before Kahn's death, the American Institute of Architects presented him with a special award, the citation for which read:,  Master of concrete and steel, master of space and time, he stands today at the forefront of our profession in meeting the colossal demands of a Government in need. [15],  Kahn's greatest significance in architectural history is his design of technologically innovative industrial buildings of ""utmost simplicity, rational construction, functional efficiency and a striking expressive aspect.[16] However, he is also renowned for changing the skyline of Detroit with his institutional, commercial and residential buildings of exceptional merit. Fifty of his buildings in the city and environs have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, honoring the exceptional breadth of Kahn's design repertoire. It was in his non-industrial work that he showed himself to be a keen student of historical architecture, having sketched many works of antiquity and later centuries during his European travels. Many of his residences, synagogues, bank buildings and office structures pull from classical, Italian Renaissance or English Tudor and Georgian sources. He showed versatility and innovation in his pairing of industrial-style reinforced concrete and steel structures with an historic aesthetic in many of his buildings.,  Even before designing Packard Number 10 (1905) for Henry Joy, Kahn was experimenting with reinforced concrete in the design of the Palms Apartment House (1902) on Jefferson Avenue with George Mason. He used industrial steel trusses to support the dome of another early work, the Temple Beth El (1903) on Woodward Avenue. This oldest synagogue building in Detroit was inspired by the Roman Pantheon, a photo of which was framed over Kahn's desk. Its severely altered French Classical facade is now the Bonstelle Theater of Wayne State University. Kahn's design versatility is also seen in his National Theatre (1910) on Monroe Street. Here he collaborated with his chief designer Ernest Wilby to bring together Baroque, Moorish and Beaux-Arts elements in an imaginative, terra-cotta building, which was breathtaking when the lattice-work twin-towers were illuminated at night.,  Kahn's residential work also demonstrated his design versatility and ability to combine structural innovation with historical architectural elements. In his own house on Mack Avenue (1907) and in other residential commissions for captains of industry, Kahn showed a penchant for English Domestic Revival and Tudor styles, as seen in George Booth's Cranbrook House (1907), with its use of Arts and Crafts detailing and Pewabic tiles. The later English Cotswold-style mansion of Edsel and Eleanor Ford in Grosse Pointe Shores (1929) is considered one of his finest residential designs. Here Kahn used industrial-style concrete for the floors and steel roof trusses, but faced the building with traditional sandstone. The roof stones were split by expert English craftsmen who were imported to Detroit for this project, along with the materials.,  Kahn's facility with a broad palette of historical styles influenced his design of many of Detroit's commercial and institutional icons, which contribute to the character of the city even today. His famous Detroit Athletic Club (1915) was inspired by the New York work of McKim, Mead and White and by Rome's Farnese Palace, which Kahn toured and sketched in 1912. The Italian Renaissance style was selected to give this important meeting place for leaders of the automobile industry the appropriate elegance and dignity. Between 1911 and 1926, Kahn completed numerous corporate buildings which combine industrial structure with traditional stylistic elements: Detroit Trust Company (1915), Detroit News Building (1916), First National Bank (1922) and the world famous General Motors (Durant) Building (1922) are among a few of these. The GM Building was the largest office building in the world at that time, with four cross-wings of 15 stories each, which ensured that each of the 1,800 offices had access to natural light and ventilation. With a Sullivanesque, skyscraper-style concept of base, shaft and capital, this monumental 1,320,000 square-foot structure is known for its Italian Renaissance, triple-arched entry with Ionic pilasters and its two-story-high, capital crown of Corinthian columns. Thought by many to be ""Albert Kahn's personal masterpiece in commercial architecture,""[17] the building was renovated in 2002 by Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. for the State of Michigan at a cost of $126 million.,  As the Art Deco style took hold in the mid-1920s, Kahn showed himself to be a master of this vocabulary as well, using the New York formula of step-back massing in his Detroit Free Press Building (1925) and Maccabees Building (1927). However, it was his 28-story Fisher Building (1927) which attracted national attention when the Architecture League of New York recognized it as the year's most beautiful commercial building in 1928. The Detroit chapter of the American Institute of Architects named this historic icon the ""Building of the Century""[18] in 2000. Because the seven Fisher brothers of Fisher Body Company envisioned the finest office building in the world, which was to anchor a second Detroit commercial district, they gave Kahn no budget for this Art Deco masterpiece. Kahn installed a 3,000-seat theater within the building, applied an exterior trim of solid bronze and designed the interior with 40 shades of marble and a vaulted arcade. A final Art Deco Kahn building of note is the Livingstone Light (1929-1930) on Belle Isle, a 58-foot-high, marble and bronze monument to William Livingstone, who had founded the Lake Carriers Association in 1901.,  Just as Kahn used many of the structural principals of his industrial buildings in his commercial designs, so too in his buildings at the University of Michigan, he showed a commitment to providing natural lighting and ventilation to the students and faculty who labored within. Between 1903 and 1938, he worked with Presidents James B. Angell, Harry B. Hutchins and Marion L. Burton to design 23 buildings and additions, significantly changing the skyline of the university at a time of tremendous growth. From the Engineering Building (1903), with its pioneering reinforced concrete structure, to Hill Auditorium (1913), the Natural Science Building (1917) and General Library (1919), with their brick, stone and tile strapwork trim, Kahn divorced himself from the Gothic Academicism of traditional university architecture with new elements which both delighted and angered alumni/ae. His prolific work on the campus in the first two decades also included the Helen Newberry and Betsy Barbour Residence Halls (1915 and 1918) and Sigma Phi and Delta Upsilon fraternity houses (1898 and 1903), among others.,  During the post-war building boom of the early 1920s, Kahn served as consulting architect on the university's ""Committee of Five,""[19] composed of President Burton, Professor John Shepard, Regent William Clements and Regent Benjamin Hanchett. The committee was appointed to make all decisions related to the construction of new buildings. During this time he designed the William L. Clements Library to house the regent's collection of rare Americana. Using Italian Renaissance design elements which he had seen and sketched on his trips to Europe, Kahn created a majestic, triple-arched portico for this architectural gem, which is said to have been his favorite building. For the commanding Literary Building (Angell Hall, 1922), he used a monumental Doric portico to remove attention from the long, horizontal structure behind it, which was reminiscent of his non-production, industrial buildings. Other important campus works were the University of Michigan Hospital (1920), the Simpson Memorial Institute for Medical Research (1924), the Museums Building (1927) and the Burton Memorial Carillon Tower (1936).,  Albert Kahn was honored for his achievements in modern industrial architecture many times during his illustrious career. He received honorary degrees from the University of Michigan in 1933 and Syracuse University in 1942. In 1937, he was awarded the ""Chevalier Legion D'Honneur"" by the Republic of France and a gold medal at the Paris International Exposition of Arts and Sciences. In addition to the special award given to him by the American Institute of Architects for his wartime service in 1942, he also received the Frank P. Brown medal posthumously from The Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania in 1943. Kahn's success in pioneering a global industrial architecture was predicated on his pragmatic, solution-oriented mind, his interest in technological innovation, his ability to listen to his clients' needs, his indefatigable energy and his legendary work ethic. Kahn's famous quote below succinctly sums up his views on industrial architecture: In spite of the fact that architecture today is in my opinion only about 10% art and 90% business, the architect must have constantly before him the final result - the artistic, the practical and the economic.[20],  Albert Kahn passed away on December 8, 1942.  Well after his death, his architectural firm, Albert Kahn Associates, Inc., remains an international leader in the design of highly specialized, efficient, flexible, and expandable factory buildings that enhance the flow of the manufacturing process.  Examples of such factories include the Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corporation USA assembly plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, and the BMW Manufacturing Corporation assembly plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina.[21],  In addition to designing and building numerous factories and buildings across the United States, Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. has designed a number of notable buildings in Michigan since 1942, including the Providence Medical Center in Novi, Michigan, the Ford Research and Engineering Center in Dearborn, Michigan, and the General Motors Building Prototype Wing 4A, and Grand Circus Park, in Detroit, Michigan.  On the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor in particular, Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. constructed a number of prominent buildings in recent years that have become part of the public ""face"" of the university.,  One such building is the University of Michigan's University Hospital, which was built on top of a bluff overlooking the Huron River and the city of Ann Arbor.  This hospital is considered to be one of the best of its kind due to its maximum energy efficiency and its use of modern technologies.  It is the clinical care cornerstone of the University of Michigan Health System, which consistently ranks among the best health care institutions in the United States.  The University Hospital was planned by Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. in 1980, construction was completed in 1986, and the hospital won the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers) National Energy prize in 1989.[22],  Another prominent building is the Duderstadt Center, originally called the University of Michigan Media Union, on the University of Michigan's north campus in Ann Arbor.  The Duderstadt Center was built to change the formality of education, and was the result of advanced technologies developed with the resources of four university departments:  Architecture and Urban Planning, Art and Design, Engineering, and Music, Theatre, and Dance.  The building is structured around modern technological spaces that allow for the creation of information laboratories where students can learn through the utilization of media.  Architecturally, it is particularly known for its vast, north-facing expanse of glass that illuminates the first floor atrium and second floor lobby, as well as for the pyramidal skylight over the center of the building, which further enhances the openness of the core space.  Designed by Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. in the early 1990s, the building opened its doors in 1996.[23],  In 1998, Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. opened a second office in S√£o Paulo, Brazil.  As the world's third largest city, and the largest city in South America, the firm saw opportunities for growth and continuing development in the industrial, health care, and corporate markets of the region.  A successful part of Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. since 1998, Kahn do Brasil Ltda. strengthens the firm's ability to provide a wide variety of design, consulting, and business planning services to clients in South America and beyond.[24]  With offices in both Detroit, Michigan and S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. has built an expertise in a variety of markets, including corporate, health care, automotive, industrial, research and technology, higher education, and government.  Today, the firm ranks among the Top 200 architectural firms in the United States, and is internationally recognized for both its broad historical significance and for its revolutionary, award-winning designs.[25],  ______________________,  Notes,  [1] Speech by Albert Kahn honoring George Mason at Masonic Temple Dedication, given to Michigan Society of Architects, 1923, Box 1, Albert Kahn Collection, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan.,  [2] Ibid.,  [3] Speech by Albert Kahn given to Boston Society of Architects, ""Industrial Architecture - Its Problems and Obligations,"" 11/12/40, Box 1, Albert Kahn Collection, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan.,  [4] Richard Bak, ""Blueprint for Detroit,"" HOUR Detroit(May, 2000, reprinted by Albert Kahn Associates, Inc.), p. 2.,  [5] W.

He was the second child of Claude Henry Nims and Agnes Christine Klagstad. He had an older brother Paul Theodore Nims. When Richard was 18 months old, his mother died after giving birth to her third child. The baby also died. With his father not able to care for his two sons, he split them up to live with relatives. His mother's sister, Thora Emilie Klagstad Jones, became Richard's caretaker. Richard lived with his Aunt Thora in Toledo, Ohio until he was four years old, at which time he moved back to Detroit to live with his father and brother.,  After graduated from Eastern High School in Detroit, Richard moved to Ann Arbor to attend college at the University of Michigan. His brother Paul was already a student at Michigan by the time Richard began classes in the Fall of 1934. While in Ann Arbor, Richard was employed as a student manager and accountant at the popular student hangout the Pretzel Bell Tavern. The Pretzel Bell opened in 1934 just shortly after the repeal of Prohibition. The Pretzel Bell, located at 120 E. Liberty Street, was a few blocks west of Ann Arbor's dry line. During this time, any establishment east of Division Street was prohibited to sell liquor. Therefore, students wanting to buy a drink would have to venture to establishments located outside Ann Arbor's dry territory like the Pretzel Bell. ""The P-Bell,"" as it was commonly known, quickly became a popular, co-educational social center. At one point during his time in Ann Arbor, Richard lived in an apartment above the restaurant.,  On February 9, 1940, Richard married Margaret Alice Perry, the only child of Raymond Alvin Perry and Florence Hattie Bos. The couple married at the First Congregational Church on S. State Street and E. William Street in Ann Arbor. Over a year after their marriage, Richard graduated from University of Michigan with an A.B. degree in Economics.,  After graduation, Richard took a job with Michigan Alkali Company in Wyandotte, Michigan. On September 19, 1943, the couple had their first child, Eric Nims. Soon after the birth of their son, Richard entered the Naval Officers Training School in Chicago. He graduated from the program as a Lieutenant, Junior Grade and a navigator.,  In 1944, Richard was assigned to Landing Craft Support (Large) stationed in the South Pacific. While with his company, Richard acted as the photographer, documenting action at sea, life aboard a warship, scenery of the South Pacific, and street scenes in the Philippines and Tokyo during 1944 and 1945.,  When his naval duty ended, Richard returned to Michigan and worked at Wyandotte Chemical Corp. On June 25, 1949, Margaret and Richard had their second child, Kirk Nims, in Wyandotte, Michigan.,  In 1951, Richard was again called to serve in the South Pacific for the Korean War. Richard was stationed on the USS Corson (AVP-37). Richard again acted as ship photographer during this second tour of duty. He was discharged from the Navy as a full Lieutenant.,  Richard spent his remaining years living in Michigan with his family. He died on September 28, 1994.",

41,umich-bhl-9940,"Blanchard was Democratic governor of Michigan from 1983 to 1991. The collection is arranged mainly by unit or functional responsibility within the governor's office. These series are chief of staff/executive assistants, correspondence office, government relations, issues development, legal department, operators, personnel, press office, Upper Peninsula office, Washington office, Lansing residence, and political and campaign files. The files document the Blanchard administration's efforts in areas of education, job creation, the state's economy, environmental protection, and the rebuilding of Michigan's infrastructure.",The materials are in English.,"James J. Blanchard, as Governor of Michigan, was the chief executive of the state. He was vested with the power to execute the laws of the state and to issue executive orders. He supervised the nineteen departments of the executive branch, ran the executive office of the governor, and appointed members to state boards and commissions. The governor submitted messages to the state legislature and recommended measures considered necessary or desirable; in short, Blanchard set a legislative agenda. A key element of this agenda were the annual state budgets submitted to the legislature, recommending revenues to meet proposed expenditures. Although Blanchard had the power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, he exercised this power with care. Blanchard also was empowered to seek extraditions and issue warrants on fugitives from justice. Finally, as governor, Blanchard was the commander-in-chief of the state's armed forces. In addition to these roles defined by law, custom, and practice, Blanchard used the governorship as a platform from which to champion Michigan.,  In the course of completing the many tasks inhering in the office of governor, Blanchard and his executive office created and reviewed a welter of written documents. These records and papers provide an important source documenting the executive actions for the years of Blanchard's tenure, 1983-1990. Many are in the departmental files at the State Archives. This collection of papers at the Bentley Library constitutes that portion of executive documentation which Blanchard, upon leaving office, decreed personal in accordance with the traditional practice of recent governors of Michigan.,  The materials came from geographically distinct offices (Lansing, Detroit, Upper Peninsula, and Washington), reflected the efforts of staff ranging from policy analysts to Blanchard himself, and were preserved in varying degrees of completeness. Among these records and papers retained are: correspondence, budgets, memoranda, reports, briefing books, minutes and agenda, press releases and public statements, legal briefs and decisions, legislative bills and analyses, clippings, photographs, audiotapes, and videotapes. These materials were especially strong in documenting the Blanchard administration's investment in human capital and education, efforts to promote economic development and create jobs, interest in rebuilding Michigan's infrastructure while preserving and restoring its environmental beauty, and generally reflecting its commitment to act to promote the commonweal. The collection sheds some light on affirmative action, citizens' protection, criminal justice, the Michigan Youth Corps, and attitudes of Michigan residents as reflected in letters to the governor. The collection is weak in its coverage of Blanchard's private life and his activities related to the Democratic party.,  Researchers should note that Blanchard's executive office was not a rule-bound operation, restricted by strict adherence to hierarchical functions. There was considerable sharing of responsibilities, especially at the higher levels of the administration. One finds that roles filled by a chief of staff sometimes devolved to an executive assistant or to a staff member in the Legal or Government Relations Office. Work on large recurring projects, like the budget or the state of the state address, involved participation at many levels cutting across offices. Day to day functions, like responding to issue-oriented constituent correspondence, often entailed action by the chief of staff, counsel, or a policy analyst from the Washington Office, in addition to the expected responses from the Issues and Correspondence Offices. These sorts of overlap are noted when appropriate in the finding aid.,  The Chief of Staff had the primary responsibility for seeing to the efficient functioning of the executive office of the Governor. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Chief of Staff interacted with nearly every department in the executive branch of state government and with each unit within the executive office. The Chief of Staff served as a sort of gatekeeper for the Governor, apprising him of significant issues, informing him of how best to respond, and judging how effectively the response meets the issue. During Blanchard's two terms in office, he was served by four Chiefs of Staff: F. Thomas Lewand, Phillip Jourdan, Rick Cole, and Steve Weiss. Records are extant from each chief except Rick Cole; these range from the thin but rich records of Lewand to the more fulsome materials of Jourdan and Weiss.,  The efforts of the Chief of Staff to facilitate frictionless functioning of state governance were augmented by able deputies, competent staff, and a cadre of Executive Assistants. Chief among these assistants were Nancy Austin-Schwartz, Bill Liebold, Carolyn Sparks, and Ron Thayer. Given that the Blanchard administration was democratic and decidedly non-hierarchical, these Executive Assistants often filled roles similar to the Chiefs of Staff. At these highest levels of administration, decisions were made and actions taken without much regard to hierarchy or job description strictures. In this free market of ideas and ability, whoever had the best idea or was best able to handle a situation attended to it. Sometimes this was the chief, sometimes one of the assistants, but just as often things were handled by other members of the executive office staff or by someone from an executive department.,  The Correspondence Office was that division within the Executive Office which received, routed, and responded to constituent correspondence. In handling this task, staff in the Correspondence Office worked closely with the Issues Development Office, with head of executive branch departments, and with the Office Operations Division. Mail received by the unit was directed to specialists in Issues Development, to the appropriate state department, to the Governor's personal attention, or handled with a standard response. Given the volume of mail directed to the Governor's attention (at times reaching thousands of pieces per week) and its issues-oriented nature, one should not be surprised to find that most mail sparked a standard response. The bulk of the materials saved reflects the office's efforts to individually address constituent concerns in a timely fashion. This work originally was the domain of an autonomous Communications Unit, fell to the correspondence unit within the Operations Division for a time, until finally it was established as a separate office. Donna Kaufman oversaw this unit from 1983 until 1988 when Patrick Casey took charge.,  The Government Relations Office was the unit which tracked the Governor's legislative agenda and the executive branch's reaction to bills coming out of the legislature. The Government Relations Office served as the Governor's interface with the Michigan House and Senate. In fulfilling this mission, the office had to rely upon the advice and consent of many within the executive office, specifically the Legal Division and the Issues Office (especially the intergovernmental relations unit). This reliance on diverse input was evident in Blanchard's first term as the Legal/ Legislative/Government Relations functions were all met by a single office, headed by Conrad Mallet, Jr. There exists little to document Mallet's tenure as head of this office, aside from transition files and enrolled house and senate bills. During Blanchard's second term the legislative functions fell to separate government relations, legal, and issues offices which then maintained a close working relationship. Stan Fedewa, and later, William Kandler, directed the work of the Government Relations Office at this time. The efforts of both of these men are well reflected in the extant materials.,  The Issues Development Office was charged with delineating, articulating and disseminating the official Blanchard position on the topics of the day. These functions, central to the administration, insured that the issues office would be integral to the executive office. This is manifest in the myriad array of units heavily reliant on the Issues Development Office for their own operations; the Chief of Staff, Executive Assistants, Correspondence, Government Relations, Legal, and Press Offices all were in daily contact with Issues. Within the Issues Development Office, responsibilities were divided among analysts according to issue: agriculture, education, environment, human services, local government, and urban affairs. These analysts reported to the office manager, who in turn reported to the Deputy Chief of Staff, who checked that positions were consistent with the policy goals of the administration.,  The Issues Development Office eventually came to house the papers of the Local Government Advisor. Connie Shorter was the senior staff member responsible for local government affairs and she moved with the unit from its original home in the Policy Department, through the Government Relations Office, back to Issues. The office also served as aegis for special projects ranging from the Cabinet Council on Human Investment, to Citizens' Protection, to the Public Investment Task Force. The issues office itself underwent numerous name changes over the years, beginning as the Policy Office, then to Planning and Program Development, before settling on Issues Development in 1987. In whatever guise, under whatever name, this office remained poised to build Blanchard's stance on any issue.,  The Legal Division dealt with the many legal problems arising out of running a state government. These include, but are not limited to, issues related to administrative rules, bonds, local charters, corrections, crime, pardons, extraditions, legislation, and protection of civil rights. This rather broad array of issues eventually proved too disparate to be capably handled by the relatively small legal staff, so some duties were shunted to the Government Relations and Issues Offices. As with the government relations materials above, there are no materials from Conrad Mallet, Jr.'s tenure. Materials relating to administrative and emergency rules, bonds, local charters, pardons, and extraditions have not been retained with this collection; they are retained by the State Archives. What has been retained from the Legal Division are the papers of Mike Hodge, Legal Advisor and Special Counsel to the Governor from 1987 to 1990. Hodge's papers superbly document the legal concerns facing Blanchard during his second term.,  The Operations Division's primary function within the Blanchard administration was scheduling the Governor's out-of-office events. This entailed handling the thousands of invitations for the Governor to appear, deciding which of these events merited Blanchard's presence, making local arrangements with the advance team, briefing Blanchard on the hot-button issues, and serving as liaison between local contacts and the executive office. Jill Pennington capably directed the scheduling unit for both of Blanchard's terms as governor. During one of the periodic reorganizations of the executive office, the Operations Division oversaw the correspondence unit and a speakers bureau. Both of these proved to be outside the scope of the scheduling mission and were dealt out of operations' hand in the next office restructuring. The division remained committed to placing a prepared Blanchard before congenial forums.,  The Personnel Division was charged with filling all appointive positions in the executive and judicial branches of state government. These positions include all executive posts on boards, commissions, task forces and the executive office, as well as all court posts ranging from courts of appeals, to district courts, to the State Supreme Court. The Personnel Division was initially headed up by Ron Thayer. Shelby Solomon next ran the office. The papers related to personnel division during the tenure of both of these men was not forwarded with the Blanchard collection. All that remains are the papers of Gregory Morris, director of the division from 1987 to 1990. The materials Morris retained dealt exclusively with Blanchard's judicial appointments from 1983 to 1990. This narrow, but very important, stratum of information remains the only evidence on how and who Blanchard chose to extend his program.,  The Press Office presented the public face for the Blanchard administration. This office coordinated press conferences, released policy statements and copies of Blanchard's speeches, arranged photo opportunities, mediated with local and state media, and generally put the best possible spin on the administration. The Press Office was the single point of fixity in the field of flux that was the Blanchard executive office. This office fell under the eye of only two directors, Rick Cole and Tom Scott, during the two gubernatorial terms. Scott was with the office almost from the outset and is largely responsible for the retention of much of the materials. He treated the Press Office as the archives of the executive office, saving newspaper clippings, press releases, speeches, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs which document the public life of Blanchard. These materials provide the most comprehensive picture of Blanchard as politician, statesman, governor.,  The Upper Peninsula Office was one of the regional offices established by the executive office to better serve a specific clientele, in this case the residents of the upper peninsula. This office brought the services of state government to the more immediate attention of upper peninsula citizens. It answered constituent correspondence, served as liaison between county officials and the state, and briefed the Governor for his trips to the upper peninsula. In short the Upper Peninsula Office provided a scaled-down version of the outreach functions offered by the executive office. Tom Baldini, director of the office, filled his post so competently that he was viewed by the executive office and citizens as the ""governor"" of the upper peninsula.,  The Washington Office served as a clearinghouse for information on federal proposals, congressional legislation, and national policy developments. It also lobbied for the interests of the state. In pursuing these ambitious, if amorphous, interests, the Washington Office employed a staff of five to ten people over the years of Blanchard's tenure. The staff of the office worked with Blanchard, the executive office, and Michigan agency directors to develop responses to federal activity, to initiate timely communication between federal and state officials, and to arrange and conduct meetings and conferences when appropriate. Aside from the director of the Washington Office, E. Douglas Frost, who focused on budgets, taxes, and overall policy planning, each of the staff members in the office was responsible for broadly defined issues. Rosemary Freeman, who preceded Frost as office director, served as deputy director and handled issues related to training, labor, and education. James Callow was the legislative analyst charged with keeping abreast of economic and trade issues. Maura Cullen was responsible for social services, health and human services, and child welfare. Peter Kyriacopolous was the last of three analysts (Charlie Moses and Jo Ellen D'Arcy preceded him) who handled concerns related to the environment and transportation.","Governors -- Michigan., Governors -- Michigan., Parades -- Michigan., Political elections -- Michigan., Politics and government -- Michigan., Governors -- Michigan.","Videotapes., Photographs., Sound recordings., Digital audio files.","Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1981-1990., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1981-1990.","Blanchard, James J., 1942-, Blanchard, James J., 1942-, Blanchard, James J., 1942-","Democratic Party (Mich.), Michigan.

Blanchard, the first Democratic governor of Michigan in twenty years, won the 1982 gubernatorial election over Richard Headlee with a plurality of less than 200,000 out of three million votes cast. When Blanchard took office, the state faced its gravest economic challenges since the depression: slumping auto sales pushed unemployment over 17%, while diminishing the state's tax base; a $1.7 billion deficit loomed and finances were further straitened when the state's credit rating was downgraded; outmigration of educated and skilled workers threatened the human capital of Michigan. Working with his cabinet, public and private sector leaders, and members of the legislature, Blanchard righted Michigan's finances, upgraded the state's credit rating, and launched an aggressive economic development program to diversify Michigan's economy and provide jobs for its citizens.,  Among the recovery programs set in motion by Blanchard were: the establishment of the Michigan Youth Corps, a program which created 40,000 jobs for young people; installing a public works project which provided 50,000 jobs dedicated to improving the state's infrastructure; the formation of the Governor's Commission on Jobs and Economic Development, a coalition of business, labor, education, and government leaders; adoption of a zero-growth state budget and an unpopular temporary income tax increase; and development of an aggressive plan to protect the environment, especially the Great Lakes. By 1985, the state had turned the corner on the worst of its economic problems, achieving solvency by November and consequently having Michigan's credit upgraded to the best among American states. The Blanchard administration credited its own efforts for spurring this economic recovery.,  Blanchard campaigned in 1986 on the theme, ""Michigan, the Comeback State."" He easily defeated challenger, William Lucas, winning over 68% over the votes cast. Backed by this mandate, Blanchard embarked on a more ambitious agenda of reform. This broader program included, but was by no means limited to: strengthening the state's finances, innovation and integrity in public policy, improving education, preserving the right of choice for women, protecting children and families, and being tough on criminals. The Michigan Strategic Fund is an apt example of innovative policy designed to provide capital for small businesses and to diversify the state economy. Education was a top priority for Blanchard, and his second term saw the development of a broad array of education initiatives: the Michigan Education Trust, a state-supported guaranteed tuition program; the Research Excellence Fund, state-financed research in new technologies; the Michigan Model Health Curriculum, an ambitious effort to educate all students on good health habits; and the Michigan Opportunity Card, a surety of competence offered by the Cabinet Council on Human Investment. Michigan hosted several conferences on environmental issues as it attended to preventive and palliative measures to preserve the region's ecology. Blanchard created the post of Citizens' Protection Advisor to secure Michiganders' rights. All these efforts reveal the activist bent of the Blanchard administration.,  Blanchard came to the office of governor at a propitious moment, a time when states were taking up responsibilities shunted by the federal government. Reagan's New Federalism accelerated the shifting of powers and duties to state and local agencies, a trend initiated by Nixon's revenue sharing. Blanchard brought an apt philosophy to this situation. Blanchard described himself as, ""of the new breed of governors: innovative, flexible, global in outlook and unafraid to challenge the status quo."" These attributes served him well in meeting the needs of the Michigan citizenry and economy. His administration was pragmatic, fiscally conservative, and acted within the parameters of the possible. Blanchard shunned adherence to ideology, save the ideal that governments can, and should, act to benefit people. These traits were apparent in his administrative legacy.,  Immediately before winning his first gubernatorial term in the 1982 election, Blanchard served in the United States Congress for four terms representing several Detroit suburbs. While in Congress, he won acclaim for his work in shaping the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Act, an act which saved thousands of Michigan jobs. Blanchard's service to the people of Michigan began in 1968 as legal advisor to the Michigan Secretary of State. In 1969, he became an Assistant Attorney General and served in that capacity for five years before being elected to Congress.,  James Blanchard was born in Detroit on August 8, 1942. He earned a B.A. and M.B.A. from Michigan State University and a law degree from the University of Minnesota. Blanchard married Paula Parker in June 1966; they had one son, Jay, in 1971. The Blanchards were divorced in 1987. James Blanchard married Janet Fox in the fall of 1989. After failing to win a third term as governor, Blanchard repaired to a private legal practice. He served as ambassador to Canada in the Clinton administration and ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor in 2002.",

Although he had to go to work after only one year of high school, he later completed his preparation at Carleton Academy, and graduated from Carleton College in 1900. He married Nina Moses the same year. Burton earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Yale in 1906, and a Ph.D. in 1907. After teaching theology at Yale and serving as pastor of a church for several years, Burton was elected president of Smith College, where he remained until he became president of the University of Minnesota in 1910. In the spring of 1920 he was chosen to become the sixth president of the University of Michigan, and served from September 1920 until his death in February 1925.,  President Burton was known for his warm personality, organizational ability, and the power of his oratory, which was used to good effect to convince the Michigan Legislature of the university's great need for new buildings and increased funding for educational programs. He lent his talents to the national political scene when he gave the speech nominating Calvin Coolidge as the Republican Party's presidential candidate in 1924. Respected and well-liked by his colleagues, he worked tirelessly to carry out his broad vision of education. During his regrettably short tenure, he laid a solid foundation for the growth of the university, both academically and physically, between the two world wars.,   University of Michigan history during the Burton presidency,  When Marion L. Burton became president in October 1920, he immediately faced the need to accommodate a greatly increased student population through the expansion of departments, and the addition of new subject areas. The pressing need for more physical space resulted in an extensive building program, and the changing academic needs led to departmental additions and re-organizations. This rapid expansion of the university following World War I also necessitated various administrative changes.,  The most visible accomplishment of the Burton Administration was the expansion of the physical facilities of the campus. Following a campus-wide survey of needs, President Burton and the regents devoted their energies and attention to securing a multi-million dollar appropriation from the state legislature. When this was successfully accomplished, a comprehensive building program was adopted. With regental approval, it was put under the jurisdiction of the Committee of Five, consisting of the president and secretary of the university, Regent William L. Clements, Albert Kahn, consulting architect of the project, and Psychology Professor John F. Shepard, who acted as supervisor of plans. In June 1921, the regents decided to start the program with an addition to the Dental Clinic, completion of the University Hospital, and the construction of East Engineering, East Physics, and University High School buildings. In addition, generous private donations provided for the building of Clements Library, and the Lawyers' Club group. President Burton's untimely death in February 1925 denied him the opportunity to see all these plans completed.,  Perhaps the most vexing question of the many problems faced by President Burton in the early years of his tenure was that of the Homeopathic Medical School and Hospital. The action of the state legislature in cutting off funding for a separate school and hospital drew the attention of homeopathic doctors in the state and nation resulting in a blizzard of letters and editorials protesting any move to change the school or hospital. Nevertheless the unit was disbanded in 1921-22, when homeopathic teaching and medical care were incorporated into the University Medical School and Hospital.,  This was also a period of turbulence and re-organization in the Medical School and Hospital apart from the issues raised by the closing of the Homeopathic School and Hospital. Some major issues were whether faculty should be ""full-time"" or allowed to treat and receive fees from outside patients; the obligation of the hospital to treat indigent patients; the administrative relationship of the Hospital to the Medical School; the need for a separate Nursing School; and whether the Hospital should be self-supporting or funded by the Medical School since patients were used for teaching.,  The period 1920-25 saw the establishment of a number of academic units as separate schools, and changes and additions to the curriculum of others. The School of Education was established by the Board of Regents in May 1921, and Allen S. Whitney, who had held the chair of Pedagogy in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, was appointed dean. Under his leadership a university high school and an elementary school were established in 1922 and 1927 respectively, to meet the needs of the practical aspects of teacher training. A growing public awareness of the desirability of teaching health and hygiene in the public schools led to the development of the Department of Physical Education in the School of Education. In 1923-24, Dr. Margaret Bell became Associate Professor of Women's Physical Education but this work was felt to be more appropriate under the University Health Service. In further recognition of its public health obligations, the university organized a Division of Hygiene and Public Health in 1921. In the beginning this encompassed work in public health, physical education, intramural sports, and was closely related to the University Health Service. Eventually, these areas were divided into separate units.,  President Burton's belief that a creative artist on campus would be an inspiration to the whole university community, persuaded the regents to raise funds and authorize a Fellowship in Creative Art. Former Governor Chase S. Osborn donated funds for the first year, and Robert Frost accepted the fellowship for 1921-22. He was also on campus for the better part of following year.,  Social workers throughout the state wanted better training for their profession and their efforts led to the development of a curriculum in social work in May 1921. The Department of Industrial Research became the Department of Engineering Research in October 1920 and included the Industrial Research Laboratory which undertook research projects for Michigan's growing manufacturing industries.,  Although not formally established until 1926, plans were under way to set up a Department of Library Science. Considerable attention was given to separating the study of architecture from the School of Engineering and to incorporating an already existing correlated School of Music into the university, but neither was actually accomplished during President Burton's tenure.,  Soon after taking office, President Burton re-organized the committee structure of the Board of Regents from a system of each regent overseeing one college or school to that of committees concerned with overall functions of the university, such as Educational Policies, Student Welfare, Finance, Buildings & Grounds. Regent Lucius L. Hubbard was engaged in re-writing the university by-laws. The staffing of the president's office was enlarged, and a presidential assistant, Professor Frank Robbins, was added. The establishment of new units required the development of appropriate management plans, while older units saw shifts in their governance, such as the change in jurisdiction of the Nichols Arboretum from the Department of Botany to the Board of Regents.,  During his first year, President Burton established the office of Dean of Students and appointed Joseph A. Bursley to handle matters previously dealt with directly by the president or by various committees. The Dean of Students took over the Employment Bureau (previously run by the Student Christian Association), as well as the Student Loan Fund.,  Under President Burton the old system of departmental governance by a permanent head appointed by the administration was changed to one of chairpersons elected for a limited term and committees set up by the department. This system was started in the English Department in 1920, the Economics Department in 1921, and the Mathematics Department in 1922.,  The problem of student discipline which arose with the increased student population required the attention of the administration for some time, and work was started on a uniform code of student discipline, although it was not until later that the code was adopted.,  Various other issues received attention during President's Burton's tenure. Among the more important were the adoption of a system of retirement pay. For a number of years the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching had been providing ""retirement allowances"" to a limited number of professors. As this became inadequate to meet the needs of growing educational institutions, the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association was established, and university policies were adapted to the new system. This was also a period when renewed attention was given to the needs and interests of women students, including suitable housing and appropriate curriculum. In addition, the Student Christian Association was in need of re-vitalizing after a decline during the war years.",Burton family.

At the age of four his parents divorced, and Cisler was subsequently raised by his mother in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. In 1917, following his graduation from Westchester High school in 1913, Cisler enrolled in Cornell University. Interrupting his schooling, Cisler saw brief service in the infantry during the First World War. He returned to Cornell in 1919 where he majored in mechanical engineering. He graduated in 1922.,  After college, Cisler accepted a cadet position with the Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey. Cadets were groomed for upper level administrative positions within the company. During this two year appointment, on-the-job training was augmented by participation in company study groups and evening courses in business and economics at New York University. Over the next two decades, Cisler rose through the ranks and eventually became Assistant General Manager of Power Plants.,  In 1941 Cisler was appointed to the Office of Production Management (OPM), a division of the War Production Board (WPB). The OPM was composed of three industry consultants working in conjunction with federal planners to coordinate production for civilian and military consumption. As a member of the Power Division, Walker Cisler was responsible for balancing allied demands for electricity against domestic power requirements.,  While engaged in this war service, Cisler accepted a position as Chief Engineer of Power Plants with the Detroit Edison Company. Effective October 1, 1943, this appointment was not actualized immediately as Cisler was first commissioned as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army and sent to the Mediterranean theatre to survey electrical facilities. This three-month term of service was repeatedly extended and a promotion to full Colonel followed. In 1944, on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Army, Walker Cisler was appointed to General Eisenhower's staff as Chief of the Public Utilities Section, Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF). In this position, he assumed primary responsibility for the restoration of electrical services in recently liberated areas.,  With the cessation of hostilities in Europe, Cisler served in Berlin as Chief of the Public Utilities Section in the Office of Military Government of Germany. Even with the termination of his active duty status in late 1945, Cisler continued his involvement in European reconstruction as principal advisor to the State Department on electrical power issues. He also worked as chief consultant on electrical power to the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) and successor organizations, the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA), and the International Cooperation Administration (ICA). Cisler was officially discharged from military service in 1952.,  Upon his return from Europe in 1945, Cisler assumed the duties of Chief Engineer of Power Plants with the Detroit Edison Company. By 1947 he had also been appointed Vice President of Employee Relations. In 1948, his expanded duties were consolidated under the title executive vice president. In 1951, he was appointed to the Board of Directors and subsequently promoted to President and General Manager. Upon the retirement of Prentiss M. Brown in 1954, Walker Cisler was confirmed as Chief Executive Officer of Detroit Edison. He served in this capacity until 1971 at which time he was succeeded by William G. Meese. In 1964 Walker Cisler was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors, a post he held until 1975.,  While at Detroit Edison, Walker Cisler focused a great deal of attention on the development of atomic power as a commercial resource. To this end he served as Executive Secretary to the Industrial Advisory Board of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) beginning in 1947. Under his direction, the board issued a report to the AEC in 1951 requesting permission to begin industrial development of a fast neutron breeder reactor. This report led directly to a feasibility study conducted by the newly formed Nuclear Power Development Department of the AEC. By 1953, twenty-six power utilities and large corporations nationwide had expressed interest in collaborating on the project. And in 1954, Congress amended the Atomic Energy Act and thus empowered the AEC to license the distribution of fuel for commercial nuclear development and to exercise oversight of construction and safety standards.,  Having cleared all legal obstacles to the construction of a commercially managed nuclear reactor, a consortium of electric power systems, engineering, and manufacturing firms established in 1954 the Atomic Power Development Corporation (APDA). Recognized as a leader in the field, Walker Cisler agreed to serve as President and to work to coordinate collaboration in the research and development of a fast neutron breeder reactor. Power Reactor Development Associates (PRDC), a companion corporation to APDA was established to handle actual construction and operation of the first commercially managed nuclear reactor. With Walker Cisler as President in 1956, PRDC functioned as a legal buffer in limiting the liability of APDA's member organizations. Under Cisler's guidance, APDA and PRDC jointly constituted a vehicle for national participation in the development of the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant at Lagoona Beach, Monroe County, Michigan. As a member of both APDA and PRDC and through the involvement of its managerial and technical personnel, Detroit Edison participated in the construction and operation of Fermi. Detroit Edison also owned and operated the steam generators and steam turbine facilities needed to convert heat generated by the reactor into electrical power suitable for distribution.,  Over the next seventeen years, from 1955 to 1972, Cisler and the Fermi plant were closely associated in the public's mind. Despite the ultimate failure of the plant (the reactor was decommissioned in 1972), Cisler never wavered in his espousal of the need to develop peaceful uses for nuclear power. He also saw the need to involve the international community in this effort. He was among the founders of the World Power Conference (WPC) and its successor organization, the World Energy Conference (WEC). In 1968, Cisler was elected chairman of the International Executive Council of WEC, and in 1974, under his leadership, Detroit hosted the meeting of the full body of the WEC.,  Cisler retired from Detroit Edison in 1975, but remained active in the international energy scene primarily through his work with Overseas Advisory Associates Inc. (OAAI), which he had founded in 1972 to utilize the expertise of retired energy executives for overseas consulting. OAAI functioned globally, but focused on activity in the Middle and Far East. The most intensive OAAI contracts involved the establishment of a modern energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia.,  In addition, Cisler was active in scientific, civic, political, and business affairs throughout his career. He served as the long-time Chairman of the Thomas Alva Edison Foundation. He also served on the boards of directors of a wide range of organizations devoted to revitalizing Detroit and improving the public welfare. He presided over many programs sponsored by the Economic Club of Detroit and served as a member and interim Chairman of Freuhauf Corporation's Board of Directors.,  Walker Cisler remained active in his many endeavors until his death on October 18, 1994 at the age of 97.",

Previous titles of the office were: Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs and Provost, 1983-1995; Vice President for Academic Affairs, 1962-1983; and Provost, 1938-1962.,   Provost,  The origins of this office date back to 1938, during President Ruthven's administration, when the position of provost was created by a bylaw of the Board of Regents to ""aid the President by performing such of the President's functions as shall from time to time be delegated by him or by the Board of Regents"" (Regents' Proceedings, March 1938, p. 505). E. Blythe Stason, the dean of the Law School who had already been performing many of these functions, was appointed the first provost. Stason resigned as provost in November 1944 to devote his attentions to the leadership of the Law School, and James P. Adams, vice president of Brown University and former University of Michigan economics professor, assumed the post of provost and professor of economics in January 1945. At the Regents' meeting of January 1945 the bylaw establishing the provost's position was amended to include the statement that the provost ""shall be the chief executive officer of the University next to the President"" (Regents' Bylaw 2.02). Adams remained the provost until his resignation in July 1951. A successor to Adams was not named, and the responsibilities of the provost were absorbed by the newly created vice president and dean of faculties, Marvin Niehuss.,   Vice President for Academic Affairs,  In 1962 two new positions were created in the university administration: executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs.,  Marvin Niehuss, vice president for university relations since 1945 and the vice president and dean of faculties since 1951, was promoted to the position of executive vice president in 1962. As vice president and dean of faculties, Niehuss had coordinated university relations with the state legislature and had overseen the administration of the schools, colleges, and other units (including institutes, Extension Service, summer session, and the Reserve Officers' Training Corps), reporting on enrollment, teaching loads, research, and faculty salaries. In his new position as executive vice president, Niehuss continued to supervise legislative relations and served as the University's contact with the state board of education. In addition, the executive vice president was the chief executive assistant to the president and assumed the duties and powers of the president in his absence. (When Niehuss retired in 1968 the position of executive vice president was abolished and a vice president for state relations and planning was established in its place.),  Roger Heyns, a member of the Psychology Department and since 1959 dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, was appointed to the position of vice president for academic affairs in 1962. Heyns assumed many of the duties previously performed by the vice president and dean of faculties. He was given general executive responsibility for the faculty and for the academic programs of the schools, colleges, and other educational units. He reviewed recommendations of deans, directors, and department heads with regard to appointments, promotions, leaves of absence, and salaries of faculty members and special service personnel. In addition, the Offices of Admissions, and Registration and Records--previously under the jurisdiction of the vice president for student affairs--were brought under the vice president for academic affairs.,  This reorganization of administrative responsibilities was intended as a means of unifying planning in a period of rapid growth of the University. In actual practice, the duties associated with planning remained dispersed and were shifted from one office to another in the 1960s and 1970s. When a vice presidency for state relations and planning was established in 1968, some of the responsibility for academic program planning was transferred to that office. The Office of Institutional Research, which collected and analyzed data on enrollment trends, faculty characteristics, funding, and related subjects, was transferred in 1969 from Academic Affairs to State Relations and Planning. In 1974 the Office of Institutional Research was renamed the Office of Academic Planning and Analysis and was returned to Academic Affairs, reflecting the assignment of additional evaluation and planning responsibilities under the vice president for academic affairs. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the vice president for academic affairs gradually assumed greater responsibility for budget preparation.,  In addition to program and budget planning, the Office of Academic Affairs was involved in implementing affirmative action plans, overseeing the Opportunity Program and Tuskegee-Michigan exchange program, and coordinating support services for minority students.,  When Roger Heyns left the university in 1965 to become chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, he was succeeded by Allan F. Smith, the dean of the Law School. Smith held the post of vice president for academic affairs for nine years and in 1974 was followed by Frank H. T. Rhodes, a professor of geology and since 1971 dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Rhodes resigned in 1977 to assume the presidency of Cornell University.,  Harold T. Shapiro, chairman of the Economics Department, was appointed vice president for academic affairs in 1977 and held the position until 1980, when he became president of the University of Michigan. Alfred Sussman, dean of Rackham School of Graduate Studies, served as acting vice president for academic affairs from November 1, 1979 through July 1, 1980, when Billy E. Frye, professor of Zoology and dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, assumed the position.,   Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost,  At its February 1983 meeting, the Regents of the University of Michigan changed the title of the position to Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost (hereafter referred to as ""provost""). The move to include ""provost"" in the title was taken in part because of the increased responsibility of the vice president within the university's administration and because of the need to assist the president as he moved into state and national projects, notably the management of the capital campaign fund-raising effort.,  In 1986, Billy E. Frye resigned and was replaced by James J. Duderstadt, dean of the College of Engineering, who served as provost until he became the president of the university in September 1988. Robert Holbrook served as interim provost until December 1988. In January 1989, Charles Vest, dean of the College of Engineering, became provost and remained until July 1990, when he left to assume the presidency of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Holbrook served as interim provost for the month of August, after which Gilbert Whitaker, dean of the School of Business Administration, began his tenure as provost.,   Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs,  In September 1993 the Regents approved a change in title to provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. This title was intended to reflect more accurately the responsibilities of the provost and to ""bring Michigan into line with the administrative structures of other universities"" (The University Record 49(3), 1993 September 20: 4). The new designation came about when President Duderstadt recommended a change in title for Whitaker. In 1995 Whitaker returned to teaching and was succeeded by J. Bernard Machen, dean of the School of Dentistry. Machen initially served on an interim basis before agreeing to accept a two-year appointment. He did not seek an extension and was succeeded by Nancy Cantor, dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies in 1997.,  The position vice provost for academic affairs was created in 1990 to recognize university-wide activities in which John H. D'Arms, dean of Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, was engaged that were beyond the scope of his decanal responsibilities. Such responsibilities included overseeing the Bentley Historical Library and the Clements Library, evaluating promotion and tenure dossiers, and serving as liaison between the university and major foundations (The University Record 45(24), 1990 March 26: 1). With the appointment of new provosts the functional responsibilities and reporting relationships of the vice provost have frequently changed.",

The society combined social activity with promotion of the interests of the University in its early years, but was not particularly important to the running of the University. In 1874, however, the society began to take a more active role, establishing the Williams professorship fund, which was used for the support of retired professors., In the 1870s alumni of the professional schools began to organize their own societies, law alumni in 1871, the Association of Medical Alumni in 1875, and dentistry, pharmacy, and homeopathic medicine alumni by 1884. After a financial scandal in the Society of Alumni came to light in 1889, a movement began to consolidate all the alumni societies, in order to improve confidence in the organizations. In 1897 the societies were combined into the Alumni Association., The new society soon began to expand its activities. It bought the Michigan Alumnus, a private publication founded in 1894, to serve as its official organ. The number of local alumni clubs was expanded and an endowment fund was established to support the association's activities., Although the University began to support the Alumni Association financially during Shirley W. Smith's tenure as secretary of the association (1901-1904), the University's support of the association increased greatly with the appointment of Harry Burns Hutchins to the presidency of the University in 1910. Hutchins saw the association as a potentially important source of funds for the University. The Association's ties with the University's development activities became even stronger after World War II, when the Phoenix Project, the $55 Million campaign, and other campaigns relied heavily on alumni support., In 1923 the structure of the association was changed, with the local alumni chapters becoming the basic units of the organization. At this time a field secretary was also appointed, to stimulate the development of the local chapters and organization of districts., By the end of the 20th century the Alumni Association boasted more than 104,000 members. The mission statement described the association as ""an independent worldwide organization that nurtures lifelong relationships with and among current and future Michigan alumni. As a committed partner of the University, the Association offers programs of relevance and service to alumni and creates support for the University. Underlying all that we do is the belief in the value of education to the well-being of society, and a commitment to integrity, diversity, and service."" Activities include organizing alumni excursions and lecture tours, coordinating reunions, operating a career assistance network, and offering lifelong learning opportunities.,   The Alumnae Council, Until 1914, when an alumnae representative was added to the board of directors of the Alumni Association, alumnae were not organized at the university level. A number of alumnae clubs had been organized in various localities, but there was no central organization. In 1917 a Central Coordinating Committee was formed as a part of the Alumni Association, to allow alumnae to support the needs of women students. At that time, the University was the first co-educational institution to be represented at an Alumnae Conference held in Washington, D.C. Prior to the establishment of the university organization, however, University of Michigan alumnae took an active role in the building of the national Association of Collegiate Alumnae, now referred to as the American Association of University Women. Alice Freeman Palmer, President of Wellesley College, (1876, Ph.D. hon, 1882) was one of three University of Michigan women who established the Association in 1882 in conjunction with women from the University of Wisconsin, Oberlin College, Boston University, Cornell, Vassar, Smith, and Wellesley., The original University of Michigan organization functioned as a central correspondence committee whose purpose was to keep in touch with the needs and life of women at the university and report activities to the alumnae. In the first year, there were 14 alumnae groups in various cities throughout the United States. The first meeting of all University of Michigan alumnae was held in 1917 in Ann Arbor to discuss projects for the organization to undertake that were important to the University's women. From that meeting came the plans to fund and construct Alumnae House, the first women's residence., In 1920, the central correspondence committee changed its name to the Alumnae Council of the Alumni Association to better reflect the growing function of the committee as an integral part of the Alumni Association. It was also decided to admit representatives from each of the alumnae groups to the Council. In 1921 a constitution for the organization was adopted. It was also in 1921 that the Council began a campaign to raise $1,000,000 for a women's building to meet the social as well as the educational requirements for women on campus. By 1926, the money was raised and in 1928 the cornerstone was laid for the Michigan League building., In 1930, the Council began a program in cooperation with the Graduate School to aid women with financial needs. The first graduate endowment fund established was the Lucy Elliot Fellowship. This was soon followed by the Alice Crocker Lloyd Fellowship. The Henderson House, a women's cooperative dormitory, was also established, with residence based on scholastic achievement. The Council continues to sponsor scholarships for women in addition to other fellowships and loans., The Council's activities remained somewhat independent of those of the Alumni Association until 1955, when an attempt was made to integrate alumnae activities into those of the Association., University of Michigan Black Alumni (UMBA), Established in 1976, and under the guise of its former title (the African American Alumni Council (AAAC)), the UMBA was created with the purpose of addressing issues, providing support, and enhancing the educational experience and performance of African American faculty, staff, and students of the University of Michigan.  The Council also serves to increase the involvement of African American alumni in University of Michigan  programs, activities, and events.  In 1994, the African American Alumni Council was formally incorporated as an affiliate member of the University of Michigan's Alumni Association.  In conjunction with the Alumni Association, the Council sponsors several key events, programs and awards including the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Symposium and Scholarship, the Dr. Leonard F. Sain Award, the Annual Reunion of Black Graduates, the Camp Michigania retreat, as well as numerous programs, including the Minority Recruitment program. , Current information is available at the Alumni Association's web site at the following URL: https://alumni.umich.edu/",

The number of commercial courses in the department expanded steadily, and in 1904-05 a ""Certificate of Commerce"" was authorized for those who had specialized in the field. Growth, both in terms of students and courses continued, with a sudden upswing of interest immediately after World War I leading to the decision to create a separate School of Business Administration. Preliminary plans for the school were begun in 1922, but significant progress occurred after February 1923, with the hiring of Edmund Ezra Day as chairman of the Department of Economics. Day came to Michigan with an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth and a Ph.D. from Harvard. He was authorized to found the new school which was formally established in 1924, with Day serving both as dean and also as Economics chairman. Day's tenure, however, was relatively short. He took a leave of absence during 1927-28, and formally resigned his post soon afterward to join the Rockefeller Foundation.,  In Day's absence Clare E. Griffin, who was professor of marketing, was first named acting dean, and was formally appointed to the post in 1929. Griffin had received his undergraduate degree from Albion College and a Ph.D. from Illinois in 1918. Under Day and Griffin the school's curriculum was largely patterned after that of Harvard, focusing upon graduate education. Admission to the school was preceded by three years study in the liberal arts. The school awarded two degrees, a Master of Business Administration (MBA) and a doctorate (beginning in 1935). Perhaps because of the focus upon graduate education, the school did not follow the custom of the day in recruiting businessmen to serve as part-time faculty. Rather, a full-time, academically-trained, staff was retained.,  In addition to normal classroom activities Day and Griffin oversaw the creation of two special bureaus. The Bureau of Business Research was founded in 1925. Its purpose was to facilitate research by members of the faculty through the publication of scholarly work and also to facilitate teaching by developing and publishing case studies useful in class work. The Bureau of Industrial Relations was founded in 1935. Made possible by a gift from the Earhart Foundation, this Bureau was established in response to the growing complexity of employee-employer relations. At its annual conference, and through other devices, it brought together corporate representatives to discuss issues in labor and personnel relations.,  In 1944 Russell A. Stevenson replaced the retiring Griffin as dean. Stevenson had received his bachelor's degree from UM in 1913, studied at the University of Iowa from which he received a Master's degree in 1915, and then returned to Michigan for his doctorate, which was awarded in 1919. From 1920 to 1926 he headed the Department of Commerce at the University of Cincinnati. In 1927 he became dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of Minnesota, the position he held until he came to Michigan.,  Stevenson refocused Michigan's curriculum towards undergraduate education. A Bachelor of Business Administration degree had been established in 1942, primarily to meet the needs of the Armed Forces. Stevenson developed and expanded this program, capitalizing on the influx of post-war students to build enrollment to a peak of 1,249 in 1949. Stevenson began the school's first off-campus credit program, improving the non-credit offerings that had been first made available through the university's Extension Service in 1938. By 1960, credit courses were being offered in Detroit, Grand Rapids and Midland.,  Despite his emphasis on undergraduate education, Stevenson did modestly expand the overall scope of the school's graduate program. In 1954 a new Master's degree in Hospital Administration was created, and in 1957 a Bureau of Hospital Administration was founded. Stevenson also obtained for the school its first adequate physical facilities. At its founding the school had been located in Tappan Hall, a site it shared with the College of Education and that, even in the 1920's was considered inadequate. Despite Tappan Hall's inadequacies, the school remained there until after World War II, when a new building was constructed on Monroe St.,  In addition to his academic activities, Stevenson served in several organizations and businesses. He was active in both the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business and the Economic Club of Detroit. He also served as a director for several commercial enterprises, most notably for Lear, Incorporated.,  In 1960 the retiring Stevenson was replaced by Floyd A. Bond. Like his predecessor, Bond had Michigan roots. All of his academic degrees were awarded to him by UM, a bachelor's degree in 1938, a master's in 1940 and a doctorate in 1942. Bond served on the UM Economics faculty from 1938 until 1946. From 1946 to 1948 he taught at Carleton College, and from 1948 until 1960 he served at Pomona College.,  Bond returned the Michigan's business administration program to its original emphasis upon graduate education. The MBA and Ph.D. programs were invigorated, and off-campus education was strengthened on the Dearborn and Flint satellite campuses by applying the same admission standards there as were used in Ann Arbor, both for day and evening students.,  Bond also established a number of new programs within the school. An Institute for International Commerce was established in 1966. Its creation, while not directly linked to other programs in the school, complemented foreign based outreach programs established with the National Chengchi University in Taiwan, the Netherlands School of Economics, and involvement in the University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia. The school's long-standing interest in bringing prominent individuals to campus to address students and faculty was furthered by the establishment of the Executive in Residence and Actuary in Residence program, as well as the creation of the McInally Lecture Endowment Fund, designed to establish an annual lecture at the school by a business figure of stature. In addition to the intellectual changes Bond brought to the school, he also oversaw the enlargement of the school's physical facilities. In 1972 an Assembly Hall, which included Hale Auditorium, was dedicated, and in 1976 the Paton Accounting Center was opened.,  In addition to his academic responsibilities, Bond served his profession in several other capacities. He was extremely active in the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business, serving on the Standards Committee (1962-66), and Executive Committee (1963-71) and being elected president of the organization for 1968-69. Bond was a longtime member of the Economic Club of Detroit's Program Committee. He also served for a brief period (1959-60) as the director of the Center for Economic Development's Business-Education Division. In addition to these activities, in 1960 Bond traveled to the Soviet Union as part of a delegation of economists invited to visit that nation by the Soviet Academy of Sciences.,  In 1979 Bond reached the mandatory retirement age for university administrators. While he continued to serve the school as a professor, he was succeeded as dean by Gilbert A. Whitaker, Jr. Whitaker had received his BA from Rice University, and his master's and doctorate from the University of Wisconsin in 1958 and 1961 respectively. Between 1960 and 1966 he served on the faculty at Northwestern University. In 1967 he joined the faculty at Washington University at St. Louis and in 1969 he was named the associate dean of the business school. In 1976 he left St. Louis to become dean of the M.J. Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University. Whitaker was appointed Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs in 1990, and was succeeded by B. Joseph White., White served as dean from 1991 to 2001 and was succeeded by Robert J. Dolan. In 2005 the School of Business Administration was renamed the Ross School of Business in honor of Stephen M. Ross, a 1962 graduate of the school. Dolan served as dean until 2011 and under his leadership, Ross become one of the top ranked business schools in the country for its BBA and MBA programs. , Alison Davis-Blake served as Dean from 2011 to 2016. Davis-Blake focused on revising the curriculum for the school's degree programs, expanding global partnerships and creating the Sanger Leadership Center and Och Initiative for Women in Finance. She also helped to finance the reconstruction of Kresge Hall and the building of Jeff T. Blau Hall. , Davis-Blake was succeeded by Scott DeRue in 2016. DeRue had served in leadership roles at Ross since 2007, including as Associate Dean of Executive Education, one of the premier executive education programs in the world.  As dean, he has prioritized action based learning and creating transformative student experiences at while maintaining its status as one of the top ranked business schools in the world.

The first generation of Slighs to come to western Michigan was James W. Sligh (1821-1963) who was a clothier and not a furniture maker. Immigrating from Scotland to Canada in 1833, and from there to Rochester, New York, in 1838, James W. Sligh finally settled in Grand Rapids in 1848. When civil war broke out, he entered service as captain with Company F, 1st Michigan Engineers and Mechanics. He died November 15, 1863, from injuries received from a train derailed by Confederate guerrillas.,  Though still a boy at the time of his father's death Charles R. Sligh (1850-1927) worked to help support his family. Following a series of odd jobs, Sligh was apprenticed for four years to a local tinsmith. He clerked for one year at the Foster and Stevens Hardware Store, and then in 1875, he went to work in the finishing room of Berkey and Gay, Grand Rapids furniture manufacturers. He was soon promoted to foreman of the finishing department and then became one of the salesmen for the company. Sligh was probably the first furniture salesman to make extensive use of photographs in his sales presentations. Up until that time, salesmen usually followed carloads of their companies' furniture into various cities along the train route. From the railroad yards, they would call the local dealers down to examine their wares, and sales would be made directly from the train. Using photographs enabled Sligh to open up new markets without being tied to the railroad.,  On February 24, 1880, Sligh and his brother-in-law Lewis Hawkins organized the Sligh Furniture Company. With Sligh as president and chief salesman, the company prospered and grew. In the 1890s, with bicycling a new and popular fad, Sligh attempted to diversify his company to include the manufacture of bicycle wheels. This venture proved a failure, and thereafter, Sligh devoted most of his business energies to furniture manufacturing in general and the Sligh Company in particular. He developed new sources for the mahogany needed in his production by organizing a company which cut lumber in Honduras and then transported it to Grand Rapids. He established an agency in England for the sale of his furniture. He was president of the National Furniture Manufacturers Association (1888-1892), and was for many years president of the Grand Rapids Furniture Manufacturers Association. And in 1900, when his supply of mirror glass was restricted by a cartel of French, German, and Belgian manufacturers, Sligh traveled to Europe and sought out a supply of glass from a number of small, independent Belgian manufacturers.,  With his company well established, Sligh began to devote more of his time and effort to politics and public service. He was a member of the Grand Rapids Board of Education in 1882 and 1883, and was active in local Republican politics. In 1895, Sligh split with his party over the question of bimetallism. He advocated free silver and was one of the organizers of the Silver Republican Party in Michigan. In 1896, he was nominated by the Free Silver Republicans, the Democrats, and the Populists to be the fusion candidate for governor. He was defeated in this election by Hazen Pingree. In 1906, Sligh ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Grand Rapids. In 1912, Governor Chase S. Osborn appointed him to the state's Workmen's Compensation Commission; and in 1915, he was made a member of the Grand Rapids Charter Commission which drafted that city's charter. Sligh was elected state senator for his district in 1922, and in 1924, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican gubernatorial primary.,  Sligh was also involved in local philanthropic pursuits, including the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, and the planning for a proposed (but never completed) Sligh Memorial Hospital for Children. Among other business interests, Sligh was president of the Santiam Land and Timber Co., president of the Clark-Sligh Timber Co., and secretary-treasurer of the Clark Iron Co., which had large holdings of mineral lands in the Mesabi Range. Sligh died September 15, 1927.,  With his death and worsening business conditions in the furniture industry, the Sligh Furniture Company floundered and failed. Its assets were liquidated in 1932. Charles R. Sligh, Jr. (1906- ) who had gained experience in his father's business, was forced to begin anew a business which would have the family name. In 1933, this Sligh together with O.W. Lowry, who had been the company's superintendent, pooled their resources to purchase an idle furniture factory in Holland, Michigan. The Charles R. Sligh Company gradually grew. In 1940, the two men opened another plant (the Sligh-Lowry Company) in Zeeland, Michigan. This was followed in 1945 by a third company, the Grand Rapids Chair Company, then by a fourth, the Sligh Furniture Showrooms in New York City.,  Charles R. Sligh, Jr., like his father, was concerned with national economic issues. As a skilled debater, he became a spokesman first for the furniture industry and then for all of American business through his work with the NAM, the National Association of Manufacturers. Sligh was chairman of the NAM's taxation committee, and in 1952 was vice president of the NAM's Michigan-Ohio region. He was elected president of the NAM in December 1952, and after his term expired in December 1953, he was elected chairman of the NAM Executive Board. In April 1957, he was elected chief administrative officer and executive vice president of the organization. While with NAM, Sligh gained fame as spokesman for the business point of view in a series of debates with labor leaders, notably George Meany and Walter Reuther.,  Though a Republican like his father, Charles Sligh Jr. never ran for high public office, preferring instead to express his political views through his NAM activities. He did serve as chairman of the Kent County Republican Party in 1952 and was an acquaintance of many national Republican leaders.,  Robert Lewis Sligh (1928-2012), was Charles Jr.' son. Robert ""Bob"" Sligh got his first job as a hand sander at the Baker Furniture, Inc. in Holland, Mich. in 1945 at the age of 17. In 1946 he enrolled in the Furniture Course at the University of Michigan, a course established by Charles R. Sligh Jr. and Chuck Kindel of Kindel Furniture. The course was headquartered in the Wood Technology Department of the Forestry School. Robert Sligh graduated with a B.S. in Wood Technology in 1949, followed by a summer at Wright-Peterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, becoming a Reserve Air Force officer. Robert Sligh served with the 32nd Air Division Defense as Officer in Charge of Intelligence Flight. In 1954 he was released from active duty and joined the Sligh-Lowry as Assistant to the Sales Manager.

As a military family, the Corbusiers travelled between U.S. Army bases in Arizona, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Kansas, and the Midwest, including Fort Mackinac and Fort Wayne in Michigan (1882-1892). In 1893, Harold Corbusier entered the University of Michigan where he joined the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He received both his Bachelor of Science and Medical degrees in 1899., 
Military Career, After completing his education at the University of Michigan, Corbusier joined the Medical Department of the United States Army Reserve where he served in numerous military campaigns from 1900 to the end of World War I. From 1900 to 1905, Corbusier served as Acting Assistant Surgeon and in this capacity participated in the China Relief Expedition from 1900 to 1901 and in the Philippine Campaign from 1901 to 1902. Corbusier left active service in 1905, settling in Plainfield, NJ to raise a family with his wife Louise S. Corbusier, a Michigan native (1875-1964). The couple was married in 1930 and had two children, Frances (O'Brien) Corbusier and Nancy (Knox) Corbusier, born in 1913.   , 
In 1909, Corbusier began his service with the National Guard of New Jersey.  In 1911, he joined the Organized Reserves (Army). In 1916, Corbusier began his service with the New Jersey Guard on the Mexican Border. Here he organized and commanded the Guard's first medical units, also known as the ""Sanitary Train.""  From 1917 to 1919, Corbusier served as a major in the United States Army Medical Corps.    , Corbusier was placed in a number of leadership positions during and immediately after World War I, specifically between 1916 and 1919.  He organized the Division of Orthopedic Surgery with the Surgeon General's Office (S.G.O.) subsequently serving as the Chief of Orthopedic Surgery.  He also organized the first Reconstruction Company in the U.S. for soldiers with physical challenges.  This system was later adopted by the War Department for Development Battalions.  Corbusier served as Chief of the Orthopedic Service and instructor at the Medical Officers' Training Camp in Fort Oglethorpe, GA and as Chief of the Orthopedic Section and training officer at Camp Meade, MD. Corbusier also served as the First Assistant to the Chief of the Orthopedic Service, and as Chief of the Reconstruction Section of General Hospital #3 in Colonia, NJ.  , 
In 1920, Corbusier was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the Medical Section Officer's Reserve Corps. During this period, Corbusier was also appointed as U.S. Delegate to the International Congress of Arthritis. In 1922, he was appointed Chief Surgeon for the 12th Army Corps Reserve and circa 1931, he was promoted to Colonel in the Medical Corps (U.S. Army).  Between 1933 and 1948, Corbusier was also appointed as a U.S. Delegate to several International Congresses and travelled to Madrid, Brussels, Bucharest, Lima, and Havana. , Medical Career, After leaving active military service in 1905 and moving to Plainfield, NJ, Corbusier opened a private orthopedic clinic in 1908.  In 1911, he joined the hospital staff at Muhlenberg hospital in Plainfield where he organized the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Physical Therapy. In 1913, he was appointed Junior Attending Surgeon in the Department of Surgery. That same year he was also appointed Clinical Assistant in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. In 1916, Corbusier was appointed instructor in the Orthopedic Surgery Department. In 1923, Corbusier was named Muhlenberg hospital's Senior Attending Surgeon in Orthopedics. In 1936, he was appointed as Muhlenberg's Resident Consulting Surgeon. In 1945, he served as a consultant to the hospital's Physiotherapy Department.  , 
Inventions, Corbusier used his talents and knowledge of orthopedic medicine to pioneer the U.S. Army's system of reconstruction and devised a system of ""Recruit Rehabilitation and Training in Development Battalions."" The latter being a manpower salvage method adopted by the U.S. Army for all large military camps.  He also used his talents to design a special Army shoe known as the ""Doughboy,"" that was worn by soldiers during WWI to counteract ""Foot Weakness."" He also designed the guidon, the first distinguishing flag used by the U.S. Army's Medical Department. ,  
Civilian Life and Activities , Corbusier's civilian life was heavily intermingled with his military life. He served as an orthopedic and physio-therapeutic consultant to the Bureau of Public Health Service and as a consultant in Orthopedic Surgery and Physiotherapy to the Rehabilitation Commission of the American Legion in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.  He also lent his consultation services to the U.S. Senate Committee for the investigation of the Veteran's Bureau.  , Corbusier served as the President of the Association of Military Surgeons, President of the Academy of Physical Medicine of the United States, Vice-Chair of the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Rehabilitation Committee, Vice President of the American College of Physiotherapy, and Board member of the National Society for Crippled Children and Adults.  He lent his services to the American Red Cross, the Association of the Medical Reserve Corps, the College of International Surgeons, numerous Military Orders, and the University of Michigan Alumni Club. Corbusier also served as an honorary member of the Mexican Association of Military Surgeons and the Russian Veterans' Association. , Harold Dunbar Corbusier passed away on August 31, 1950, leaving behind a long and distinguished career as a retired Colonel, military surgeon, and civic leader.

Rackham School of Graduate Studies., Michigan Historical Collections., University of Michigan -- Buildings.","The origin of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL) can be traced to two related projects initiated in the 1930s at the University of Michigan. In early 1934, Professor Lewis G. Vander Velde successfully applied for a $700 grant to locate and collect printed material relating to the history of Michigan. Approximately a year later, in November 1935, University of Michigan President Alexander Ruthven appointed a Committee on University Archives and authorized it to gather together the university's historical records. Vander Velde served as secretary to this committee. Space was set aside in the William L. Clements Library for both projects, and Vander Velde, with the assistance of a single graduate student, undertook both projects. In June 1938, the two enterprises moved into three rooms of the newly completed Rackham Building. That same year the Regents named the endeavor the Michigan Historical Collections (MHC). In 1973, the library moved from its quarters in the Rackham Building into the newly completed Bentley Historical Library on the university's north campus. For the first time, the MHC had for a home a facility designed and built for the processing and use of the manuscript and archival materials that it had been collecting for nearly forty years.,  In the formative years of the MHC, Vander Velde supervised a surprisingly large staff. Funds from the Works Progress Administration made possible the hiring of a large number of special assistants. In 1939, twenty individuals were packing, processing, and cleaning records as they were collected. Although World War II quickly drained away the funds used to pay these many employees, a great deal of work was accomplished and Vander Velde retained some professional assistance. In 1938 or 1939, Vander Velde hired a full-time assistant primarily to collect historical records. In 1951, he added a permanent printed works librarian to the staff.,  In 1947, Vander Velde was appointed chair of the university's history department. To lighten his administrative burden at the MHC, F. Clever Bald was appointed to the newly created post, assistant director. Vander Velde retained the title of director of the MHC until 1960, when he retired and was succeeded by Bald. In 1966 Bald retired and was succeeded by Robert M. Warner. In 1980, Warner resigned as director to become head of the National Archives. Richard Doolen served as acting director until 1981 when Francis X. Blouin, Jr. became the fourth director of the BHL. Blouin served more than thirty years, stepping down in 2013, to be succeeded by Terrence J. McDonald, the former dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts.,  In 1979, a separate program for the administration of the university archives was formally established. The University Archives and Records Program (UARP) became a separate division alongside the MHC, which continued to focus on documenting the state of Michigan. Reference services and conservation were reconfigured as divisions providing a structure of four divisions (MHC, UARP, Reference and Access, and Preservation and Conservation) under the broader designation of the Bentley Historical Library (BHL).,  In 2004, an addition to the Bentley Historical Library's building was completed. This project increased the storage capacity for the library's collections and provided new offices for staff members of UARP. The new wing's dedication coincided with the publication of The Bentley Historical Library: Its History and Purpose, an in-depth review of the library and its collections.,  Francis Blouin also oversaw the creation of the Digital Curation Division in 2011. The unit was given responsibility for implementing solutions for the long-term preservation and management of the library's digital assets. Digital Curation supports the mission of the library's other branches by administering born digital and digitized materials for the University Archives and Michigan Historical Collections and also promoting access to digital archives for Reference and Access Services.,  In September 2013 Terrence J. McDonald, former Dean of the university's College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, assumed the directorship of the Bentley Historical Library. Under his leadership, the library hired its first development officer and participated in the university's Victors for Michigan capital campaign. McDonald also oversaw the reorganization of, the library's units in the summer of 2014. The Academic Programs and Collection Development division assumed responsibility for classroom instruction, reference and access services, outreach, and field work at the University of Michigan and around the state. The Curation division rationalized the processing activities of the MHC, UARP and the Digital Curation Division, incorporating procedures for both physical and digital archives, and also assumed responsibility for web archiving and digitization activities.",

The AIJLS was created by the United States War Department in order to build an elite corps of Japanese-speaking officers, who were to do intelligence work and provide support for combat troops. The school was an intensive course, consisting of intensive Japanese language and culture classes, as well as military drills, inspections, and typical army exercises characteristic of U.S. military training camps.,  Goodman's class (Company A, 3651st Service Unit), graduated from AIJLS on January 4, 1944, and continued on to complete further training at the Military Intelligence Service Language School in Minnesota (MISLS). There, they underwent courses in the more technical and complicated aspects of intelligence work, and graduated on November 18, 1944. The soldiers were then sent to basic training at Fort McClellan in Alabama, and went on to join combat units in China, Burma, India, New Guinea, the Philippines, Australia, and Hawaii, where they served as translators and interrogators for Japanese prisoners of war. After the surrender, most of the AIJLS graduates became part of the Japanese occupation forces.,  After the war Goodman returned to the University of Michigan where he received his masters degree in Far Eastern Studies under Professor Joseph Yamagiwa in 1939 and a PHD.,  Goodman worked as a professor of Japanese history at the University of Kansas for thirty years, and spent time in the late 1980s and early 1990s at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in Kyoto, Japan.,  Goodman is the author of ""Amerika no Nippon Gannen (America's Japan: The First Year)"", published in 1990.,  Goodman was instrumental in organizing reunions for students in the first two AIJLS courses at Ann Arbor. In May 1990 the last major reunion of the Ann Arbor AIJLS students was held in Ann Arbor.

In 1969, she enrolled at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). She received a Ph.D. in Anthropology from the SOAS in 1974. Her thesis was entitled ""The people of Dingri: a socio-historical portrait of a district in S.W.

Radio Tahrir (Radio ""Liberation"") was the first radio program in the United States dedicated to Arab culture and society. Originally, the program focused on uplifting the voices of members of different Arab communities from around the world. It expanded its coverage in circa 1993 to include the voices of Muslim Americans, during which the program was briefly known as ""Arab Voices, Crescent Rising"". , Radio Tahrir ultimately sought to highlight Arab and Muslim community members' lived experiences, accomplishments, and challenges, particularly as it related to Islamophobia and civil rights. Radio Tahrir typically aired every week on Tuesdays or Saturdays in 30 or 60 minute episodes. These episodes featured a variety of content, including interviews and discussions with invited guests. In addition to its regular programming, Radio Tahrir also produced documentaries; specials, particularly during the month of Ramadan; and series, such as ""Maqam: From Cordoba to Baghdad"" (circa 1997), ""6 Arab American Poets"" (1997), and ""Fen Mejnoon with Dean and Maysoon"" (2004-2006).

Dr. Aziz recruited these volunteers and interns because she viewed Radio Tahrir as a space where Arab and Muslim community members could voice their concerns as well as become more deeply engaged with the public sphere and radio journalism. Many Radio Tahrir volunteer producers were also Muslim women whose positionality offered unique opportunities to address issues like discrimination in mosques and Muslim children's educational needs. , In addition to her work at Radio Tahrir, Dr. Aziz supported WBAI Radio and the Pacifica Network in other ways. She traveled throughout the Middle East, interviewing and providing reports for use in their programs as well as Radio Tahrir. She also spent a significant amount of time in Iraq documenting the impact of the United Nations sanctions in that country in the years following the Invasion of Kuwait. She also hosted the WBAI Radio current affairs program Behind the News from 2000-2002, and participated in other WBAI and non-WBAI programs, including Labbrish, The Morning Show, and TalkBack., As a result of her work at Radio Tahrir, Dr. Aziz founded the Radius of Arab American Writers Inc. (RAWI) in 1993. RAWI is a national literary and networking organization focused on supporting Arab American writers. She served as RAWI's director until about 2005. Her other professional activities included spending a year (2007-2008) at Algeria's University of Oran as a Fulbright Scholar as well as working and teaching in Syria (from 2009-2012)., Dr. Aziz has published numerous books over the years, including Heir to a Silent Song: Two Rebel Women of Nepal (2001),  Swimming up the Tigris: Real Life Encounters with Iraq (2007), Short Features for Radio: A Manual for Broadcast Journalists (2011), and Yogmaya & Durga Devi: Rebel Women of Nepal (2020). She has contributed to several blogs and websites, including CounterPunch, her personal website's blog, and the Radio Tahrir blog. , Dr. Barbara Nimri Aziz currently resides in New York.",

His father was a sales representative for and officer of a successful Flint printing company (the Riegle Press) founded in 1924 by his stepfather, John L. Riegle (1887-1983). The latter, a 1905 graduate of Central High School, was born on a farm in Davison Township, served as Genesee County Commissioner of Schools from 1914 to 1923 and wrote a memoir Day Before Yesterday (1971). In 1928, John married Bessie (Waterman) Smith, and he later adopted Donald Wayne Smith, her son by her first husband, Roy Tenny Smith. The Riegle family came to Genesee County in the early 1860s from Clarence, Erie County, New York. Don represented the fifth generation of his family to have lived in the county. Don Riegle's mother was the daughter of a Canadian-born farmer who lived in Huron County, in the Thumb of Michigan, who later worked for AC Spark Plug in Flint. His first political inklings, therefore, were undoubtedly formed by his family background.,  He was raised in the Dakota-Franklin neighborhood of Flint's blue-collar east side. His Republican father had served as city commissioner from 1950 to 1952 and mayor of Flint from 1952 to 1954 under the weak-mayor charter. One time during his father's tenure as commissioner an unknown assailant blasted a shotgun through the family's front window, indicating the danger of Flint politics. He attended the Flint Public Schools, graduating from Central High School in 1956. He then went to Flint Junior College for a year and Western Michigan University for a year, before enrolling as a business administration major in the Flint College of the University of Michigan, from which he graduated with a B.A. in 1960. Furthering his education, he went to Michigan State University, where he received an M.B.A. in finance and marketing in 1961. He then went to work for IBM, living in Brewster, New York. He entered the Graduate School of Business Administration at Harvard University in 1964 with the intention of pursuing the D.B.A. degree, but his political activity unfortunately prevented completion of the thesis requirement.,  He first married, on September 15, 1957, Nancy Brandt, of Flint, who was beginning her first year of college at the University of Wisconsin. A Chicago honeymoon was aborted by a robbery while seeing her off at the train station. Subsequently a story in the Chicago Tribune about the robbery led readers to contribute to the young couple's expensive stay at the Hilton Hotel. They had three children: Caetheirne (known as Caethe) A., born October 8, 1958; Laurie E., born December 14, 1962; and Donald Wayne III, born January 24, 1968. He married, as his second wife, Meredith Ann White, niece of Supreme Court Justice Byron White, on January 14, 1972, but they divorced in 1977. He married, on May 1978, in Reed City, Michigan, Lori L. Hansen (born November 1, 1953), a staffer in Sen. Gaylord Nelson's office. They had two daughters: Ashley Hansen, born February 1, 1985, and Allison Elizabeth, born January 20, 1992.,  An opportunity to run for U.S. Congress presented itself in early 1966. Running as a Republican in the heavily Democratic 7th District, Riegle defeated incumbent John C. Mackie by a vote of 67,690 to 58,226. He soon acquired a reputation as a maverick and received criticism for not following Republican policies. In 1968, the left-leaning magazine The Nation chose him as one of the two best congressmen of the previous year. The Flint-area UAW regional council and locals took the unusual step of supporting him in 1970. The liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him, in 1972, a ""liberal quotient"" of 94 percent. Nevertheless, he still was available to get Republican support; in 1972, for example, the Ripon Society endorsed him. In each election up to 1972, he increased his percentage of the vote. In that year his share was more than 70 percent.,  In his first two Congressional terms, Riegle rapidly became known as a dove on Vietnam. In 1967, he organized a Vietnam study group with University of Michigan professors. In September 1969, he co-sponsored, with Paul McCloskey, the first measure in Congress to repeal the unofficial declaration of war (the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution). This action resulted in a threat of censure. Nevertheless, President Nixon signed the repeal on December 31, 1969. Riegle continued to press Nixon on his promise to end the war, despite all his obvious actions to the contrary.,  In response to a request from Doubleday editor Trevor Armbrister, Riegle consented to write a book that intended to ""portray the human side of Congress honestly and to reveal its inner workings."" The candor that Armbrister wanted would involve risk for anyone who might attempt such a book, yet Riegle wrote, in a narrative that takes the form of a diary O Congress (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1972). The book covers a year, from April, 1971 to March, 1972. Response to the book by reviewers and the public was generally favorable.,  Riegle went to the Republican National Convention held in Miami in August, 1972, in order to speak against Nixon's bombing policy. However, he was denied access to the full platform committee and had to address a subcommittee, which, in the words of Norman Mailer, ""had been scheduled late so as to keep him out of morning hearings which might get on TV prime time or newspaper deadline time."" Riegle impressed the author as ""young and personable with blond hair which he wore at a generous enough length to reach his collar (Mailer St. George and the Godfather, 127-130)."" During his re-election campaign, Riegle not only refused to endorse the Nixon-Agnew ticket, he actively campaigned against it.,  The Congressman's criticism of Nixon's Southeast Asia policy and his actions during the 1972 campaign inevitably led to his becoming a target of the President's opprobrium. On February 27, 1973, Riegle left the Republican Party for the Democratic Party. He resigned his Appropriations Committee seat and was assigned by the Democrats to the Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1974, he ran for re-election as a Democrat and won with 67 percent of the vote. His growing stature as a maverick captured attention. In that year Time Magazine named him one of America's top 200 leaders under the age of 45. Riegle felt a sense of vindication for his opposition to President Nixon when the Watergate scandal broke. Soon after Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox, Riegle gave a floor speech announcing that he was initiating formal impeachment proceedings for obstruction of justice and other criminal charges.,  In 1975, Senator Philip Hart announced his retirement with the end of his term in 1976. Riegle decided to pursue this office, and won the primary against two other candidates (including an upset victory over Secretary of State Richard Austin. In 1976, the Detroit News publicized an affair he had in 1969 with an unpaid staff member, who had taped their telephone conversations, but this newspaper's attempt to influence the election failed. Senator Hart died on December 16, 1975, before the end of his term, and the Governor appointed Riegle on 30 December 1976 to fill out the remaining three days of Hart's term. In the general election, Riegle won, with 53 percent of the vote. He announced, on the first day of his term of office (January 3, 1977), that he and his wife had agreed to separate and seek a divorce.,  With his business school background, Riegle was appointed in his first term to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs (of which he was a member throughout his tenure), the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (serving until 1988), and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources (serving until 1984). He was a member of the Committee on the Budget from 1979 to 1994 and the Committee on Finance from 1987 to 1994.,  Riegle's management and Republican Party background was unusual for a politician who enjoyed such a strong UAW backing, but this probably led him to find ways to support positions benefiting both auto industry management and labor. He led the fight for the Chrysler Corporation loan guarantee, averting a filibuster, during his first term. Industry-friendly positions on environmental and safety issues brought him criticism on the left from sources such as the New York Times and Ralph Nader, but Riegle gained a reputation as a hard-working senator supporting the needs of his constituents.,  He established seven Michigan offices (Detroit, Flint, Lansing, Traverse City, Grand Rapids, Warren, and Marquette, a far larger number than most senators had, in order to maintain a better relationship with his constituents. He secured many Urban Development Action Grants before the program ended.,  As a Democrat, Riegle was in the minority party during Reagan's tenure as President, and as a member of several economic committees, was a frequent critic of Reaganomics. Minority leader Robert Byrd said of him: ""He's a good man to have in your front line. He knows how to mold the bullets and shoot them."" Riegle was chosen to deliver the Democratic response to President Reagan's address (on October 14, 1982) on the economy.,  Riegle tirelessly advocated for economic issues, especially those that might benefit Michigan. He led a successful fight against cuts in Social Security during the 1981-1982 session. He supported the position of the auto industry regarding Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAF√â) standards in 1991-1992. He successfully offered an amendment to a 1988 trade bill, which attempted to increase American exports. He introduced legislation in 1991 which would attempt to increase exports to Japan.,  In January 1989, Riegle became chairman of the Banking Committee. During his earlier years on that committee, he had, as chairman of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, affected legislation on debt collection and consumers' rights in electronic banking. Now his focus would be on the savings and loan crisis. Riegle led the Senate fight that enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989, which created the Resolution Trust Corporation. This and other actions successfully ended the crisis.,  The Senate Select Committee on Ethics began public hearings on November 15, 1991, following an investigation that had begun two years earlier, to ask Riegle and four other senators (John McCain, John Glenn, Dennis DeConcini, and Alan Cranston) what they had done for Charlie Keating and what the bankrupt owner of Lincoln Savings and Loan had done for them. Keating's former lobbyist James J. Grogan told the committee on December 14, 1990 that Riegle had arranged a meeting on April 9, 1987 on Keating's regulatory problems, following a fundraiser that Keating had sponsored for Riegle in Detroit on March 23, 1987. Riegle later gave him back the money that had been raised. Despite Riegle's denial of any wrongdoing, the committee rebuked him and Dennis DeConcini on February 27, 1991. The committee determined an appearance of improper conduct but chose not to recommend further action against them. Later that year, the New York Times called for Riegle to step down as Banking Committee chairman, but Senator George Mitchell countered, noting that the Senate had passed a broad banking reform bill under Riegle's leadership that month.,  In his last years in the Senate, Riegle spent much of his time involved in trade issues and on Clinton's health care reform efforts. The impending election, however, cast a shadow, with Republicans sensing a vulnerability that had not been there before. Thus, on September 29, 1993, Riegle announced that he would not seek re-election. He felt that without needing to campaign again, he could now devote more time to health care and oppose the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) without being accused of any political motivation. He also cited an ""increasing toll on family life."",  Riegle supported labor's NAFTA position in opposition to President Clinton, bringing back the reputation he had as a maverick when he opposed President Nixon on Vietnam. He felt that he needed to support Michigan's autoworkers, and he worked toward that end. He staged a controversial anti-NAFTA rally with Ross Perot in Lansing on September 18, 1993. Ultimately, however, his effort failed, as Congress ratified NAFTA. Riegle supported the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and he cast his last vote in favor of ratification.,  He led the Banking Committee to investigate the Gulf War Syndrome, and on May 25, 1994, the committee issued a report. It implied that the United States had approved certain chemicals for sale to Iraq and that these may have shared some responsibility for the causes of the Syndrome. Riegle was portrayed by Brian Denehy in a mini-series Thanks of a Grateful Nation, about the Syndrome, appearing on the Showtime Channel and NBC in 1998 and 1999.,  He was succeeded in January 1995 by Spencer Abraham, Republican. The Riegles bought a house in Traverse City that year and later built a house in Birmingham, completed in 1998. He joined Shandwick Public Affairs, a public relations firm, as executive committee chair, and began an association with the Michigan State University School of Business as adjunct professor. In 2001, he joined another public relations firm, APCO Worldwide, as chair of its government relations department.,  Among the many awards he received, he said once that he was proudest of one that the Wolverine Bar Association gave him for having nominated more Federal judges of color than any other Senator. In the public arena, the Flint Jewish Federation established the Donald Riegle Community Service Award in 1990, in honor of the Senator's efforts on behalf of Soviet Jewry.",

He completed his undergraduate education at the University of Illinois in 1910, majoring in botany. He continued his graduate and doctoral studies at the University of Michigan, receiving his Ph.D. in Botany in 1912. Gates departed for a faculty position at the University of the Philippines in 1912, where he remained until 1915.

In 1838, the Herbarium's original collections were started due to state geologist Douglass Houghton's first geological survey of Michigan. In 1839, Dr. Houghton was appointed as Professor of Geology and Mineralogy, and the collected specimens were placed under his supervision. During the 1840s, the collections were moved into Mason Hall and the University continued to receive donated specimens, including from Dr. Houghton and from Abram Sager (Mains, 1442-1443).,  In 1855, the collections were gathered into the developing natural history museum under the direction of Alexander Winchell. At this time, the botanical specimens were under the same purview as geological and zoological specimens. Through the 1860s and 1870s, the Herbarium continued to receive donations, including from botanists Dr. George L. Ames, Josiah T. Scovell, Mary O. Rust, and Marcus Baker. These collections were placed under the now established Museum of Zoology. To manage the collections, Mark Walrod Harrington was appointed as an assistant and cataloged the collections. In addition, Louisa M. Reed and Elizabeth C. Allmendinger provided voluntary support to develop the herbarium and catalog the collections. Ms. Allmendinger engaged in plant switching with other institutions and published a list of plants within the Ann Arbor area, donating her personal collection to the herbarium (Ibid., 1443-1446). Throughout this time, professors in the Department of Botany were active in development of the collections. This established a norm where botany professors concurrently acted as curators of herbarium collections.,  In 1876, Assistant Professor Joseph Beal Steere and Volney M. Spalding were placed in charge of the herbarium's collections. In 1879, Steere was given the official title of Curator for the museum. An 1881 reorganization of the museum by the Board of Regents split the management of the geology, zoology, and botany collections, stipulating that the professor in charge of instruction for a given topic should be the curator of its museum collection. As the Professor of Botany, Volney M. Spalding thus became curator. In the same year, the collection moved into the newly constructed museums building, with a new herbarium workspace established in 1893. During this time, although the Museum of Zoology had the official herbarium collections, the Department of Botany maintained a separate herbarium collection (Ibid., 1446-1447; Bartlett, 9).,  The early 20th century saw significant changes for the botanical collections and the ultimate formation of the U-M Herbarium. In 1904, Spalding resigned, and Frederick Charles Newcombe was appointed Professor of Botany while Charles A. Davis was appointed curator of the collection. In addition, in 1905, the state legislature passed a bill establishing a new biological survey of Michigan under state geologist Alexander G. Ruthven. Due to the increasing collections, and increased interest in the collections, in 1908 staff numbers increased and in 1912, the curation of the collection was split into Curator of Cryptogamic Herbarium (Calvin H. Kauffman) and Curator of Phanerogamic Herbarium (Henry A. Gleason). A disastrous fire in 1913 destroyed a significant portion of the collections and a new museums building was not completed until 1915. To grow the collection, many new donations were received, including from Charles Keene Dodge, of the Michigan Biological Survey. Dodge's collection of 35,000 specimens was curated separately under Cecil Billington.,  The herbarium as it stands today was established in 1921 under Director Calvin H. Kauffman. In 1921, the botanical collections, the herbaria of the Department of Botany, the herbarium in the Museum of Zoology, and Dodge's collections were united into the Herbarium of the University of Michigan and given a separate budget. Kauffman and John H. Ehlers were appointed curators, with Cecil Billington as an Honorary Curator. In 1926, Dr. Bessie B. Kanouse was appointed Curator and Assistant to the Director. By 1929, the Herbarium contained nearly 185,000 specimens in classified collections, and 75,000 undistributed specimens. This same year, the Herbarium purchased the collections of Professor Bruce Fink, adding over 16,700 specimens to the collection and bringing Joyce Hedrick Jones to the University as a research assistant (Mains, 1447-1449).,  In 1930, an agreement between the Carnegie Institution and the University of Michigan led to biological surveys of Central America, including British Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico, until the cooperation ended in 1939. Several U-M faculty members and staff participated in expeditions, including the Botanical Gardens Director Harley H. Bartlett, Joseph B. Steere, and Cyrus Lundell. These studies grew the Herbarium collections considerably and led to many publications about botanical research in Central America. The Second World War interrupted the activities of the herbarium. Several herbarium staff took leaves of absence to assist with the war effort, including explorations in South America for the Board of Economic Warfare, and Professor Bartlett's work with the armed forces advocating botanical collection by armed forces abroad (Ibid., 1450-1451). Following the war, the botanical collections grew significantly with continued botanical expeditions and due to donations by botanists such as A.H. Poval, Paul M. Rea, E. B. Copeland, and Harley H. Bartlett (Ibid., 1454; Rogers & Shaffer, 3-4). The acquisition of Harley H. Bartlett's specimens changed the Herbarium's collections from a predominantly locally-focused institution into a large, international research collection. (Rogers & Shaffer, 4) After 1975, the collecting policies of the Herbarium shifted towards diversifying the collections through targeted gifts and exchanges rather than through field work, however field work has continued in North America and Mexico. In 1956, the Herbarium was absorbed into the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, remaining as a separate unit until July 1, 2011 when it became part of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (Reznicek).,  The Herbarium's later research projects began with Professor Edward Voss' Michigan Flora Project, which started in 1956 and lasted for more than 40 years. The Michigan Flora Project led to the publication of the three volume Michigan Flora series and the Herbarium's current Michigan Flora database. In addition to the Michigan Flora Project, the U-M Herbarium contributed to several projects, including the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Flora Novo Galiciana, Flora of North America, Mosses of Mexico, Mosses of the Great Lakes Forests, Flora of China, and Flora of the Venezuelan Guyana. In 1974, the Herbarium was designated by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists as one of the 25 National Resource Center Collections in the United States and was ranked as one of the top three herbaria in the country. The U-M Herbarium is also a leader in digitizing herbaria collections, beginning with a 1977 database of seed plant types (Reznicek). The U-M Herbarium currently houses one of the best botanical collections in the world, housing over 1.7 million specimens, including renowned collections of vascular plants, algae, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens., -------------------,  References:,  Bartlett, Harley H.

In addition, the files include correspondence, minutes, reports, development and director topical files.",The materials are in English.,"Records of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project were received in three major accessions and from three major donors: National Executive Chairman Chester Lang, 1958; Assistant Director Leonard Greenbaum, 1972; and Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project, 2000. In addition, one item, a copy of the Phoenix Project logo, was received from Jacqueline Kolle Haring in 2001. The material is described as two accessions and is primarily comprised of records related to fund-raising, research, and administrative functions. Series include files documenting the history of the project, prospects, donors, research grants, and outreach. Researchers tracking a particular topic should note that there is significant overlap between accessions.,  The records of the first two accessions measure three linear feet and date from 1947 to 1959. They are primarily comprised of correspondence, speeches, minutes, financial reports, and research files and are arranged into four series: Chester Lang/National Executive Chairman Files; Fund-raising Campaign; Financial Reports; and Early Research.,  The records accessioned between 2000 and 2001 range from 1948 to 1997 and add 46 feet of valuable and significant documentation to the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project record group. While large portions of the records relate to development and fund-raising aspects of the project, there are also important correspondence, research, and committee files. In addition, the accession includes a rich group of materials documenting the history of the project, as well as files regarding the national and international involvement of Phoenix administrators and scientists in the nuclear energy field.,  The records are organized into the following series: History; Minutes of Meetings; Development Topical Files; Director's Topical Files; Ford Reactor; Organizations; Prospects; Donors; Research; and Audio Materials. It is important to note that since the years covered in the development topical files and director topical files series overlap, the researcher is advised to examine both runs for material on a given subject.","Nuclear energy -- Research., Educational fund raising -- Michigan -- Ann Arbor., War memorials -- Michigan -- Ann Arbor., Nuclear energy -- Study and teaching., Nuclear energy.","Sound recordings., Photographs.",,"Gomberg, H.

Walter, launched a mission to gather ideas and suggestions from prominent individuals around the world for a living memorial to the 583 students and faculty who lost their lives in World War II. On May 1, 1948, the Regents approved the recommendation of the committee for a research center that would become a ""comprehensive, non-classified, university-wide program of study of the peaceful applications and implications of atomic energy, as it affects society, education, industry, technology, and the whole body of scientific knowledge."" (Box 4, Background Material, ""The Phoenix Associates of the University of Michigan."") The program was given a name that evoked powerful symbols of hope and new life arising from the ashes of war. Within ten years, the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project was foremost among educational institutions of the world in exploring and developing peaceful uses of the atom.,  The official beginning of a ""chain reaction"" appeal to Michigan alumni to raise funds for the research center was on October 2, 1950. Signaling the opening was a full day and evening of meetings and rallies held in cities and towns around the world ""linked by telephone broadcast."" ""Using the Atom to Strengthen America"" was the theme of this first Atom Day. Atom Day subsequently became an annual tradition and a vehicle for bringing together prominent speakers and dignitaries to report to the public and industry on activities of the program.,  The original fund-raising campaign was highly structured, well organized, and infused from the start with the energy and the commitment of a broad base of Michigan alumni nationwide. Fourteen national regional committees were established with Chester H. Lang at the head as National Executive Chairman and university president Alexander Ruthven actively participating. In the first ten years, 30,000 individuals and 350 commercial firms contributed a total of $8 million to support the project. Also in its first decade, the project sponsored 185 research investigations by faculty members in fifteen of the university's seventeen schools and colleges. From these studies, more than 400 technical publications were published. A key factor in the success of the project was the broad participation encouraged across campus, an aspect promoted and maintained from the start under the leadership of physicist and dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, Ralph A. Sawyer, the first director of the project.,  As early as 1951, substantial research was under way in the study of food preservation, the preservation of metal surfaces, and age determination of pre-historic organic materials. It wasn't long before the Phoenix Project began to play an exemplary role at the university in atomic law, atomic medicine, and radiochemistry. In 1952, the Survey Research Center began a study on the impact of atomic energy on the American public, the law school began a broad investigation of the legal implications of the Atomic Energy Act, and a memorial fund for cancer research was created in honor of Alice Crocker Lloyd, former dean of women. In subsequent years, investigations expanded to scores of disciplines ranging from anthropology to zoology.,  A 1952 annual report noted that financial goals were reached and surpassed and that construction on a building would begin the following year. It would house facilities for safe handling and storage of high-level radiation sources containing laboratories for work in radiochemistry, engineering, botany, the health sciences, physics, and other fields. In 1955 bids were opened for a nuclear reactor to be built in a special unit at the north end of the Phoenix Laboratory funded through a $1 million Ford Motor Company donation. The reactor, the first ever requested for construction by an agency other than the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and one of the most powerful sources of nuclear fission outside the facilities of AEC, was dedicated on Atom Day in 1956. By 1957, the program included seven laboratories for atomic research built or equipped with Phoenix funds: Phoenix Memorial Laboratory, Ford Nuclear Reactor, Alice Crocker Lloyd Radiation Center, Alice Lloyd Memorial Center, Phoenix Radioisotope Laboratory, Plant Nutrition Laboratory, and Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory.,  In 1957, the Regents provided authorization for seeking $2 million in undesignated funds to be used for continuation of what had become the largest academic teaching and training program in the world in the field of nuclear research. Equipment and research had usurped most of the original $8 million, and discussions were inaugurated for a second campaign, geared toward implementing a five-year plan, this time in collaboration with the Development Council. (One of the early derivatives of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project campaign was the establishment of an ongoing fund-raising organization for the university. Early in 1951, the project's National Executive Committee submitted a resolution to the Board of Regents recommending such a unit, and in May of 1952, the Development Council was formally organized. Campaign efforts were thereafter designed collaboratively.),  The project garnered national and international attention as funds supporting research led to fundamental scientific discoveries, most notably Donald Glaser's development of the liquid bubble chamber, which makes possible rapid, easily interpreted photographs of rare atomic interactions. Dr. Glaser, who received the Nobel Prize in 1960, conducted his original research under the auspices and with the financial support of the Phoenix Project after other agencies had rejected his idea. Glaser, by then professor of physics at the University of California, returned to Ann Arbor in 1961 to give the first Phoenix-sponsored Dewey F. Fagerburg Memorial Lecture, a venue designed to feature distinguished contributors in the nuclear energy field. The following year, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer was invited to the podium, speaking before one of the largest audiences ever in attendance at Rackham Lecture Hall.,  Over the years, the laboratories were visited by hundreds of scientists, individuals, and government officials. In 1955, University of Michigan scientists participated considerably at the International Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva. Worldwide interest in these issues led to the founding of the International Cooperation Administration (ICA), an arm of the AEC. Under a contract with ICA, Phoenix became the primary consulting agency for providing expert advice to foreign countries initiating atomic energy programs.,  From the mid-1960s, the Phoenix Project and its associated facilities were overseen by a director reporting to the university's vice president for research and an executive committee composed of faculty members from across campus. Faculty executive committee responsibilities included budgeting and long-term planning. The committee was charged with relating the work of Phoenix to the university's instruction and research programs. By 1996, the number of research projects funded and completed had reached 816. However, the actual share of university users of the reactor had dwindled to about twenty-five percent, with industry and government accounting for the rest. At the same time, since the early 1980s the budget to run the Ford Reactor came primarily from the university itself with little support from the government or the AEC.,  In the late 1990s, with federal funding for nonmilitary nuclear research at low ebb, universities across the country began to shut down their reactors. In December 2000, University of Michigan Regents announced that because the operation continued to drain over $1 million a year from the university budget, formal processes were under way to decommission the reactor. Former university president James J. Duderstadt (who himself was attracted to the university's engineering school because of the Phoenix Project and was at the time of the announcement a key advisor to the secretary of energy and chair of the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee) began with a host of other scientists, to lobby for federal funds to keep academic reactors running.,  Although the Ford Reactor, a cornerstone of the Phoenix Project, was officially decommissioned in 2003, the Project itself was continued with a new purpose. In 2004, the Phoenix Project was given new life as the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute, and was charged with spearheading the University's efforts in interdisciplinary energy research, policy, and education. In their vote to broaden the Phoenix Project's charter beyond atomic energy, the University's Board of Regents expanded the Project's scope to encompass all forms of energy, and ensured the continued legacy of the Phoenix Project by noting that the Energy Institute would promote ""research on the development of energy policies that will promote world peace, the responsible use of the environment, and economic prosperity.""",

Netzorg and Katherine S. Netzorg were both born in 1884. Morton was a Michigan native and a University of Michigan graduate (Literature, 1910). They came to the Philippines in 1911 to teach in the Philippine public schools as part of the Tomasites teacher corps. They had three children: Morton Jacob (born in 1912), called by most ""Jock"", David Leon, and Leah. Morton and Katherine soon became prominent and active members of the Manila Jewish community, public figures, and business owners. In the 1930s Morton I. worked on bringing European Jewish refugees to the Philippines as the Jewish Refugee Committee secretary. After the Japanese forces occupied Manila on January 2, 1942 Morton I. and Katherine were imprisoned in the Santo Tomas internment camp. They were liberated by the American forces in early February 1945. In April 1945 Morton became Regional Director of the Manila branch of the National Jewish Welfare Board and worked to organize community services and activities, and services for Jewish military personnel in the Philippines. In spring 1946 Morton I. Netzorg returned to the United States and died very suddenly shortly after his arrival. Katherine, who also returned, died in 1949. David L. Netzorg died of malaria in Japanese POW camp in 1942. Leah (married name Stine) resided in the United States.,  Morton J. Netzorg arrived in the United States before the start of the War. There he met Hannelore ""Floh"" Fuld (born in 1923), a Jewish emigrant from Berlin, Germany. Hannelore subsequently changed her name to Petra and was known as Petra or Pete for the rest of her life. Morton J. and Petra were married in 1941 and had two children, Susan and David.,  In the 1950s the Netzorgs settled in Detroit, Michigan and opened the Cellar Book Shop specializing in material published in and about the Southeast Asia region and the Philippines and the Pacific Islands in particular, as well as East and South Asia, and Africa. Their business became the essential source of material dedicated to these regions in North America. Morton acquired warehouses of books, maps and other Filipiniana material, and shipped them to Detroit. He built the largest collection of Philippine children's book and textbooks. Morton himself became one of the most important bibliographers of the Philippines. He published extensively in Kinaadman (Wisdom), journal published in the Philippines, and other scholarly journals, and authored a number of important Filipiniana bibliographies and bibliographical essays, notably about children's literature and about the World War II period in the Philippines, as well as memoirs.,  Morton J. Netzorg died in 1995. Petra Fuld Netzorg continued running the Cellar Book Shop for a few years until her retirement. She died in 2008.,  Petra's mother Charlotte ""Lotte"" Fuld and her younger sister Barbara ""Bracha"" (born in 1926) left Germany for England in 1938, then settled in the British Mandate Palestine in 1939. Petra's father Lothar Fuld stayed in Nazi Germany. He committed suicide after the pogroms of November 1938. As a teenager Bracha joined the Jewish Resistance movement against the British authorities in Palestine. She was killed in action during operation ""Wingate Night"" (March 27, 1946), when the Resistance units attempting to help illegal immigrants on the S.S. Wingate to land in Tel Aviv were attacked by British forces.,  Lotte Fuld together with Petra and Morton established Bracha and Lotte Fuld Memorial Collection at the Jewish National and University Library in the late 1950s. Lotte resided in Israel then moved to California. Lotte Fuld died in 1968.","Fuld family., Netzorg family., Fuld family., Netzorg family., Fuld family., Netzorg family."

She attended the University of Michigan receiving her A.B. in 1935 and her Master's in education in 1941. Following university, Wojtowicz began working as a Spanish teacher in the Detroit Public Schools and remained employed in this capacity until the mid-1970s. In the years leading up to her retirement, however, Ms. Wojtowicz became a target of disciplinary action on the part of the Detroit School Board after her controversial decision to refuse to use the board-approved Spanish textbooks put into use in the mid-1960s, citing them as being poor tools for foreign language education and not in the best interests of her students. This event, which led to Ms. Wojtowicz being reassigned in the system, led to a publicized campaign on her behalf conducted by her colleagues and friends, and was cited at the time as sparking the first grass-roots evaluation of course materials in the history of Detroit schools.,  Wojtowicz was also an extensive traveler and spent time during her early academic career studying in Mexico. In the 1950s, she took two sabbaticals from teaching to study at the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of Seville in Spain. In 1961, she was awarded a Fulbright Exchange Fellowship and spent the year teaching English in Chile. Because of these trips, and the time spent with family members still in Poland, Wojtowicz met a number of people with whom she continued to contact late into her life. The result was a large collection of correspondence from across the world in a variety of languages.",

Both of Osborn's parents were self-tutored medical doctors. Osborn attended Purdue University, 1874-1877, but left without graduating to become a newspaperman. Starting on the Lafayette (Indiana) Home Journal, Osborn worked successively on the Chicago Tribune and the Milwaukee Journal. In 1883 he moved north, purchasing the Florence (Wisconsin) Mining News. Over the next four years he also began prospecting for iron ore in the Menominee range. In 1887 he sold the newspaper and returned to Milwaukee as city editor of the Sentinel. At the same time, he helped establish and became editor of the Miner and Manufacturer (Milwaukee). Excited by the prospects of making his fortune in mining, Osborn left soon after for Sault Ste. Marie where he could be close to iron mining regions of Michigan and Ontario. To support himself he became part owner of the Sault Ste. Marie (Michigan) News which he published until 1901, approximately the same time as his discovery of a rich iron deposit in Ontario near Sudbury. With this discovery and other investments, Osborn had the money and the time to pursue other areas of interest. He did not immediately give up his newspaper career. In 1902 he bought a half interest in the Saginaw (Michigan) Courier-Herald which he held until 1912.,  Long before Osborn left the newspaper business, he expressed an interest in Michigan politics as a Republican. From 1889 to 1893 he served as postmaster of Sault Ste. Marie; he was state fish and game warden, 1895 to 1899; state commissioner of railroads, 1899-1903; regent for The University of Michigan, 1908-1911; and governor, 1911 to 1912. He was unsuccessful congressional candidate in 1896, an unsuccessful aspirant for nomination as the Republican candidate for United States senator in 1918, Michigan's favorite son candidate for the Republican vice-presidential nomination in 1928, and an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 1930. Consistently progressive in his political sentiments, Osborn refused to bolt the Republican party in 1912, although he finally did vote for Roosevelt.,  From 1887 on Osborn made his home in Sault Ste. Marie and on nearby Duck Island. In later years he wintered in Possum Poke, Worth County, Georgia. After 1912, Osborn devoted himself to lecturing, travel, writing, and to his investments. He authored thirteen books relating to American history, politics, Indian lore, and travel. Osborn died in Georgia on April 11, 1949.",Osborn family.

In 1891 he moved with his family to the United States. Following the retirement in 1913 of his father Milton F. Bonisteel from International Harvester the family moved to Ann Arbor, where Milton became active in both the real estate and the insurance business.,  Roscoe Bonisteel received most of his early education in Pennsylvania, graduating from Harrisburg high school and receiving most of his undergraduate education at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Bonisteel received his college diploma, however, from the University of Michigan, which conferred upon him a bachelor of laws degree in 1912.,  For the next half century Bonisteel practiced law in Ann Arbor. In addition to his practice, he was active in numerous professional organizations. He was president of the State Bar of Michigan (1936-1937), an organization he helped to create. He also served as a member of the American Bar Association House of Delegates (1936-1940).,  Bonisteel's scope of activities, however, was far broader than his legal interests. He actively involved himself in politics, education, business, religion and community betterment.,  Politically, Bonisteel was a conservative Republican. He served as an active party worker throughout his life. He was elected chairman of the Washtenaw County Republican organization and was appointed to numerous state boards and commissions. In both 1928 and 1944 he was selected as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. Bonisteel remained politically active throughout the 1950s. In 1961 he was elected as a Republican delegate to the state constitutional convention. At the convention he served on several committees, but was most influential in his posts as chairman of the education committee's sub-committee on higher education, and as vice-chairman of the committee on emerging problems. Education was a continuing concern of Bonisteel. He was a trustee of Dickinson College, a member of the Board of Trustees, Cleary College, the Board of Governors, Wayne State University (1956-1959) and the Board of Regents, the University of Michigan (1946-1959). In addition he served on the Board of Directors and was chairman of the executive committee of the National Music Camp at Interlochen.,  In the business community, Bonisteel served as legal counsel for numerous corporate clients. Personally, he was a member of several Michigan firms' board of directors, including Ann Arbor Bank, Information Industry Associates, Michigan Life Insurance, and the State Bank of Frankfort.,  Bonisteel worshipped at First Presbyterian Church of Ann Arbor. He was an active member of the congregation. He served both as an elder and a trustee of the church. In addition to all his other activities, Bonisteel was involved in a host of community organizations. He was a Mason, an active 33rd degree member, and a Michigan grand master (1929-1930). He was a Rotarian, serving that organization as president of the Ann Arbor chapter (1932-1933) and as International District governor (1934-1935). He was a member of the American Legion, having been a captain in the U.S. Air Service (area intelligence) during World War I. He was elected commander of Legion post 46 (1925) and served as judge advocate for Michigan (1934-1935).

69,umich-bhl-87290,"University of Michigan administrative office, established as the Dean of Student Affairs in 1921, responsible for overseeing many aspects of non-academic student services and activities including at various times: counseling, financial aid, student housing, student activities and organizations, the health service, student discipline, and fraternities and sororities. Records provide extensive documentation of student life.",The materials are in English.,"The records of the Vice-President for Student Services provide a unique perspective to the extracurricular life and customs of students at the University of Michigan and an insight to the development of the office of the vice-president. The records span the years 1908-1985 with the bulk of the material covering 1965-1985. The material from the early years is especially rich in documenting student life from the 1920s to the 1950s. The strongest feature of this collection is in documenting the administration's response to the changing needs of students, ranging from disciplining drinkers during Prohibition, dealings with fraternities up to 1960, reacting to student protests in the 1960s to the 1988 debate over the Student Code for Non-Academic Conduct. The papers also contain materials related to students' health, housing, organizations, and activism. The coverage of these areas varies across administrations as office reorganizations altered the focus and functions of Student Services.,  This uneven documentation reflects the fact that, over time, different offices were created to handle more narrowly-defined areas of responsibility. Areas which had originally been handled by Dean Bursley under his broad conception of control over non-academic student life came to be administered by separate offices. Frequently the records of these administrative units were not included with the vice-president for student services records. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of student life, as refracted through the lens of University Administration, one should also refer to the records of the Housing Office and Student-Community Relations Office, and the papers of Peter Ostafin, director of housing.,  The Vice-President for Student Services collection consists of correspondence, reports, memos, minutes, and financial reports generated by both the University Administration and students. These materials are arranged in chronological series by the administrative head in charge of students' extracurricular affairs. The seven series are: Joseph A. Bursley, 1913-1950; Erich A. Walter, 1925-1959; James A. Lewis, 1908-1964; Richard L. Cutler, 1950-1969; Barbara W. Newell, 1965-1970; Robert L. Knauss, 1962-1973; Henry Johnson, 1950-1985. This organizing scheme required some manipulation of the files, but it best enables the researcher to trace the changing nature of the student body concerns and the development of the office itself.,  The researcher should note that the strict chronological sequencing of the series was not possible. This was due in large part to a series of office reorganizations which resulted in some files created during Bursley or Walter's tenure ending up in later series. The most significant move here resulted in Lewis' series containing a good deal of Bursley and Walter materials on fraternities and student organizations. Lewis created the fraternities subseries in 1959 and compiled the student organization subseries during a May 1963, office reorganization. The researcher should also be conscious that early series contain a variety of materials which may not reflect the full scope of Bursley, Walter, or Lewis' responsibilities. Gaps are also discernible in the later series, but these are more readily fleshed out by referring to other University collections.","Greek letter societies -- Michigan -- Ann Arbor., Minority college students., Tutors and tutoring., Veterans -- Education -- Michigan -- Ann Arbor., Greek letter societies -- Michigan -- Ann Arbor., Handicapped college students -- Michigan -- Ann Arbor., Minority college students -- Michigan -- Ann Arbor.",,,"Bursley, Joseph Aldrich, 1877-1950., Cutler, Richard Loyd, 1925-, Johnson, Henry., Knauss, Robert L., Newell, Barbara W., Lewis, James A., Walter, Erich Albert.","University of Michigan.

Vice-President for Student Affairs., University of Michigan. Vice-President for Student Services., William Monroe Trotter House (University of Michigan)","The position of vice-president for student services traces its institutional ancestry back through the vice-president for student affairs, to the director of the Office of Student Affairs, finally to the Office of the Dean of Students. Through all of these metamorphoses the office's primary responsibility was the administration of programs related to the life of the student outside of the classroom. This encompasses a broad spectrum of programs dealing with counseling, financial aid, student housing, student activities and organizations, the health service, student discipline, and fraternities. The office reflects the changing interests and composition of the student body and the increasing complexity of the University's administrative bureaucracy.,  Joseph A. Bursley, the first dean of students, took office February 1, 1921, to fulfill the Regents' dictate to act ""as friend, counselor and guide to the student body and to have the general oversight of its welfare and of its general activities."" Given this open-ended directive, Bursley soon found need to add an assistant dean and support staff to meet his mission tending to the housing, financial, social, and moral needs of students. By the time Bursley retired in 1945, the pattern of assuming increasing responsibilities with a larger staff and more complex bureaucracy was well established.,  The burgeoning bureaucracy, retirement of Bursley, and the University's growing enrollment combined to facilitate the creation of the Office of Student Affairs in September 1945. This was the first of a series of periodic efforts to define more clearly the duties of the various offices concerned with different aspects of students' lives outside the classroom. Erich A. Walter served as director of the Office of Student Affairs from 1945 until June 1954. Upon Walter's retirement, James A. Lewis was appointed vice-president for student affairs. This new title reflected the hierarchical nature of both the office and the university as a whole. Lewis stepped down in December 1964, after another reorganization of the office.,  During the latter half of the 1960s and early 1970s the University of Michigan campus was affected by student unrest, focused on the war in Vietnam as well as campus and national issues. Sit-ins, teach-ins, and more violent forms of student protest demanded the attention of the vice-presidents of student affairs and the University administration in general. Campus unrest had an impact on the Office of the Vice-President of Student Affairs and precipitated yet another reorganization of the office, this time to make it more responsive to student input. Richard L. Cutler served from December 1964 until the completion of the office reorganization in July 1968. Barbara W. Newell became acting vice-president on August 1, 1968 and served until September 1970. Robert Knauss succeeded her as the vice-president of the renamed Office for Student Services and held the post until February 1972. The changing of the guard, ongoing reorganization efforts, and the shift in focus to service stand as institutional testimony of the University's response to the chaotic times.,  The appointment of Henry Johnson as vice-president for student services in April 1972 brought a needed stability to the post and a measure of order to the situation. Under Johnson, structural changes were introduced to address the needs of some disaffected groups, who thought the University unresponsive to their needs. The offices of Minority Student Services and Disabled Student Services provided an official framework within which to advance interests. As time passed, the student body became less restive, and the vice-president turned his attention to more traditional aspects of non-academic student affairs. In January 1990 Henry Johnson was reassigned to the position of Vice President for Community Affair. Mary Ann Swain acted as interim vice president for student services from 1990 to 1992.,  In 1992, Maureen Hartford began her tenure as the vice president for student affairs. Hartford was previously the vice provost for student affairs at Washington State University and quickly rose to the task by focusing on issues such as the Student Code of Conduct, alcohol abuse, living/learning programs and students rights and responsibilities. In April 1999, Hartford left her position to assume the presidency of Meredith College in North Carolina. E. Royster Harper, who had served as the senior associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students then assumed the role of the interim vice president for student affairs. In November 2000, Harper was appointed vice president of student affairs.",

A committee was charged by Rackham Dean Stephen H. Spurr to explore the possibility of creating an African-American studies program. Interest in such a program increased in 1970, when participants in the first Black Action Movement (BAM) on campus called for the establishment of a ""Center for Afro-American Studies"" to be based on a proposal written by J. Frank Yates, Assistant to the Dean of LSA.,  When the Regents established the center in the summer of 1970, its scope was broadened to include African studies, on the expectation that, ""the study of Africa, Afroamerica, and the Caribbean within a single intellectual framework was not only defensible but represented the future direction of Black Studies."" This ""diasporic perspective"" has defined the framework for study and teaching conducted by the center's faculty. The center was to offer an interdisciplinary curriculum taught by an international faculty and had a first-year enrollment of 1,026 students. Over the next two years the center acquired a ""Writer in Residence"" program and a visiting faculty program. CAAS faculty and students envisioned a commitment to both the University and the local and regional Black communities and over the next few years, center participants worked to find the right balance between these activities.,  The Ford Foundation granted CAAS funds for the project ""From Margin to Center: Towards a New Black Scholarship,"" beginning in 1988 and additional funds for its pilot project ""Strengthening African Studies."" The program provided: a small seed grant program to foster collaborative research on Africa; helped fund a Summer Institute on Social Science Methods and African Studies; and an Africa Theme Semester.,  During its forty-year span CAAS has played host to a number of notable events and programs, including an ongoing colloquium series, the Dubois-Mandela-Rodney Fellowship Program (since 1988), and two conferences in memory of the noted poet and essayist Robert Hayden in 1980 and 1990. The center has also sponsored study abroad programs in Barbados, Jamaica, Ghana and South Africa. Since 2000, CAAS has also been the home of the South African Initiatives Office (SAIO).,  Originally, the Center sponsored an undergraduate concentration. An undergraduate minor was added in 2000 and a graduate certificate program began in 2005. First housed on Monroe Street, CAAS moved to West Hall and then to its current home in Haven Hall. Facilities have included a professionally staffed library and archives and an art gallery.,  The Lemuel A. Johnson Library at CAAS supported the curriculum by collecting and organizing archival materials related to black faculty, staff and student organizations, student activism, and national and international events relevant social justice. These files, now transferred to the Bentley, were publicly available for research and consultation. They included records relating to the BAM movements as well as several other university organizations, whose records were transferred together with the CAAS organizational archives. Brief profiles of those documented organizations follow.,  The Black Action Movement (BAM) was formed in 1970 from a coalition of the Black Student Union, the Black Law Students Association, the Association of Black Social Work Students, and groups of black students from the Medical School and the Psychology Department. They presented a list of demands to then University President, Robben Flemming. One of those demands, was, in fact the establishment of CAAS. There were two subsequent BAM episodes, BAM II (1974-5) and BAM III in 1985-7.,  The United Coalition Against Racism (UCAR) formed in the Spring of 1987 in response to a series of racist incidents on campus, including racist jokes aired on a campus radio station and a racist flyer pushed under the door of black women studying in a dormitory lounge. UCAR engaged in action aimed at U-M administrators, putting forth demands for institutional changes and convening mass protests in response to racist incidents. In addition it presented teach-ins and speakers. Originally funded by the Office of Minority Affairs (created in response to an original UCAR demand) for specific projects, other funds were provided by the organization's own fundraising and the Michigan Student Assembly.,  UCAR also founded the Ella Baker-Nelson Mandela Center for Anti-Racist Education, or the Baker-Mandela Center (BMC) during the summer of 1988. Its purpose was to collect and generate literature, provide a speakers bureau, and to serve as a gathering place for anti-racist activists. The overall objectives were to promote anti-racist consciousness and to promote anti-racist student leaders, particularly within Third World communities; to heighten the level of discussion and research on various aspects of race, class and gender issues and to provide concrete tools to anti-racist organizers to help refute stereotypes and myths, and challenge apathy or cynicism. It was housed in the East Engineering Building. Barbara Ransby and Tracye Matthews were important leaders in the organization of the center.,  The University of Michigan Free South Africa Coordinating Committee (FSACC) was a diverse campus-based group of faculty and students opposed to the Apartheid system in South Africa, founded in the Spring of 1985. The group's aims included producing literature, sponsoring events and pressuring institutions to sever economic ties with corporations doing business in South Africa. FSACC records concern activism during the 1980s and early 1990s, especially the construction of an ""anti-apartheid shanty"" on the University of Michigan Diag and a petition to grant Nelson Mandela an honorary degree.,  The Students of Color Coalition (SCC), another campus-based group, formed to protest the mocking use of Native American names, images and regalia by a semi-secret student honor society called Michigamua. In early 2000, SCC members occupied the Michigamua offices in the tower of the Michigan Union for thirty-seven days. As a result of the controversy, Michigamua agreed to stop using Native American practices, and in 2006 adopted a new name, ""The Order of Angell."", ------------------,  1.

After a period of travel and study, he joined the faculty of Brown soon after receiving his A.M. in 1853 as professor of modern languages. Angell married Sarah Caswell in 1855, daughter of Brown faculty and future president, Alexis Caswell.  He resigned in 1860 to assume the editorship of the Providence Journal, a newspaper he had been writing for since 1858. As editor, Angell was especially interested in topics relating to international law and politics.,  In 1866, Angell resigned to accept the presidency of the University of Vermont. In 1869, he was offered the presidency of the University of Michigan. After initially refusing the offer, Angell, after more than a year of negotiation with the regents, accepted the offer to come to Ann Arbor on February 7, 1871. He would remain as president until his retirement in 1909.,  Because of his expertise in international affairs, Angell was called upon for occasional diplomatic service. He was minister to China from 1880 to 1881 and a member of a commission of three to negotiate a new immigration treaty which limited but did not absolutely prohibit the entry and residence of Chinese laborers into the United States. Angell remained in China until October 1881 and resumed his academic duties in February 1882.,  In 1887, President Grover Cleveland selected Angell to serve on the Anglo-American International Commission on Canadian Fisheries. Later in Cleveland's second administration, Angell was named chairman of the Canadian-American Commission on Deep Waterways from Lakes to Sea.

She pursued her artistic studies at Goucher College, Wayne State University, the Instituto d'Allende, Mexico, and by private study with various artists. Throughout her life she was active as an artist. As Miss Michigan she was runner-up in the Miss America contest. She married William Anding Lange in 1945, whom she later divorced. They had one child. She later married Harry A. Burnett, with whom she had three more children.,  In 1962 Patricia Hill Burnett broke the all-male barrier at the Detroit Scarab Club for artists. In 1969, Burnett organized the Michigan National Organization for Women (NOW), served as its president, 1969-1971, and convened NOW chapters throughout the state.,  Her involvement with Michigan NOW led to a position on the NOW National Board, 1971-1975, and to the chair of NOW's International Committee. An inveterate traveler with a world view, Burnett was instrumental in expanding NOW into an international organization. She played a great part in organizing the International Feminist Planning Conference held at Harvard (May 1973) and convened the NOW International Feminist Conference in 1973. She also took an around-the-world trip the same year to survey the status of women in several countries. Through her organizational efforts, twenty-five NOW international affiliations were organized in twenty-one countries. Burnett was a NOW delegate to the United Nations' International Women's Year (IWY) conference in Mexico City in 1975, and to the IWY Houston Conference in 1977. As chair of the World Feminist Commission she hoped to organize the International Feminist Convention in Brussels in 1977. Burnett later attended the UN Decade for Women Copenhagen Conference in 1980. In 1987 Burnett traveled as a delegate of the International Women's Forum to honor President Corazon Aquino as Woman of the Year.,  Burnett was instrumental in organizing the Michigan Women's Republican Caucus, which she has called the ""first feminist Republican Women's Organization."" Her other Republican Party activities have included the Michigan Issues Committee and the State Central Committee. Governor Milliken appointed her to the Michigan Women's Commission in 1973; she served first as vice-chair (1975) and then as chair (1976). After serving for four years on the executive board of directors of the National Association of Commissions for Women (NACW), Burnett was elected president of NACW in 1979.,  Burnett was active in civic affairs, serving on the New Detroit Employment and Art Committees and the Detroit Human Rights Commission. She has also served as president of the Detroit House of Corrections, 1973-1976.,  Patricia Hill Burnett has lectured on women in art, women in business, and, most widely, on feminism. As a portrait painter she inaugurated and executed a series of portraits of leading feminists. These were later placed in the ""Women's Hall of Fame."",  Due to her long career as a portrait painter, Burnett was called on to be one of twelve founding members of the Council of Leading American Painters which was responsible for the organization and promotion of the Nattional Portrait Seminar.,  She received many honors for her artistic, business, and feminist activities.

His father, a Civil War veteran, worked variously as a carpenter, millwright, factory foreman, and farmer before he struck out for California in 1874, never to be seen again by his wife and only son. Despite the responsibility of supporting his mother as a farm laborer, Cobb graduated from Spencer High School and even maintained perfect attendance for numerous terms. In 1876 he moved onto the property of local businessman Charles N. Prouty and worked as a stable hand. Keenly interested in the natural world around him, Cobb saved his wages and purchased a microscope with which he gave informal lessons to the Prouty children. Encouraged by his employer, Cobb sat for the local schoolteachers' exam and was appointed headmaster of the Wire Village School before being promoted to the head of the No. 3 Grammar School in Spencer. During this time, he developed friendships with Fred Proctor and Joseph H. Greenwood, the latter of who introduced Cobb to drawing and painting and eventually gained renown as a New England landscape artist.,  As a result of his close bond with Fred Procter, Cobb lodged with the Proctor family at the outset of his teaching career. Edward Proctor, the pater familias, had settled in Franklin, Michigan (near Detroit) during the 1830s but returned to his native Massachusetts following the death of his first wife and a child in 1841. While residing in the household, Cobb became close with Alice Vara Proctor (born in Spencer on April 22, 1854), a fellow teacher, enthusiastic botanist, and skilled sketch artist. The two spent much time together studying plants and sketching their findings and were engaged in 1877.,  In 1878 Cobb enrolled in the Worcester Free Technical Institute (later renamed the Worcester Polytechnic Institute) and focused his studies on chemistry and mathematics. His thesis, ""Notes on Miller's Crystallography"" (1881), examined William Hallowes Miller's theorems in terms of analytical geometry and provided him with skills in mathematics, drafting, and optics that would be invaluable to his later work.,  Upon graduating in 1881, Cobb married Alice and began teaching at the Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts. In addition to chemistry, Cobb taught zoology, physiology, botany, and geology and also developed courses in architectural design, mechanical drawing, and topography. During their residence in Easthampton, the Cobbs had four children: Russell (b. July 10, 1882, d. March 26, 1884), Margaret (b. May 16, 1884, d. November, 1963), Victor (b. October 11, 1885, d. April 24, 1946), and Roger (b. July 28, 1887, d. January 13, 1901) and made in depth studies of the local flora and fauna.,  Despite his great skills in the physical sciences, Cobb's interests gradually turned to the life sciences and in 1887 he was accepted into the University of Jena in Germany to study under the eminent biologist, naturalist, artist, and philosopher Ernst Haeckel. In addition to practical considerations of lithography, photomicrography, and general zoological methods, Cobb's studies dealt intimately with helminthology and parasitology. Published in 1888, his thesis (Beitrage zur anatomie und Onogenie der Nematoden) examined parasitic and free-living nematodes--subject matter with which he would be associated for the rest of his life.,  In 1888 Cobb and his family made a brief tour of Germany before repairing to Naples where (at the recommendation of the pioneering marine biologist Sir John Murray) he held a seat at the oceanographic research table of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In early 1889 the family departed for Australia where they arrived on March 7, 1889. Despite recommendations from Haeckel to the Government Botanist of Victoria, scientific work was not immediately forthcoming for Cobb and he was forced to produce advertisements for Waterbury watches and other articles for the American importer Chipman. He did, however, join the Linnaean Society of New South Wales in 1889 and later that year received a temporary appointment at the University of Sydney.,  When the government of New South Wales (NSW) formed a Department of Agriculture in 1890, Cobb was appointed as the colony's first vegetable pathologist. In this position he was instrumental in helping Australian farmers find solutions to a variety of pests and diseases and implement more efficient agricultural methods. He also helped develop modern laboratories for the Department of Agriculture, established a definitive reference collection, and promoted effective research methodologies. Given his natural curiosity, Cobb examined a great many issues as a plant pathologist; he is most remembered, however, for his work with sheep flukes, sugar cane (especially the bacterial affliction known as 'gumming'), diseases affecting fruit crops, the eradication of wheat rust, and investigation of alternative wheat growing practices. Much of his work--far more varied than what is possible to review here--was collected in the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales. Cobb also had responsibility for the Wagga Wagga Experimental Farm and Farm School, was associated with the Hawkesbury Agricultural College, and worked closely with the agronomist William Farrer. Cobb is remembered in Australia as a foundational figure in the development and modernization of the country's agriculture and has been referred to as ""the Father of Scientific Agricultural Research in Australia."",  In 1899 Cobb was named a Special Commissioner to the United States and Europe (a half-time appointment) by the Government of New South Wales and embarked on a two and a half year world tour to promote Australian agriculture and exports and to research modern agricultural practices. By this time, the Cobb family had grown through the arrival of Frieda (b. October 2, 1889, d. August 29, 1977), Ruth (b. April 25, 1891, d. June 18, 1983), and Dorothy (b. October 28, 1892, d. 1977?). While in America, the family remained with relatives in Massachusetts during Cobb's travels. A major result of these sojourns was an extensive report on grain elevators and the mechanization of agriculture in California. The Cobbs' travels included stops in Europe (France, Germany, Denmark, and elsewhere) as well as Algeria before returning to the United States and setting sail for Australia in late 1900 aboard the S.S. Sierra out of San Francisco. Tragedy struck the family upon its return to Australia; Roger was struck ill with cholera and died shortly after the ship docked in January, 1901.,  Upon his return to Australia, Cobb learned that Farrer had replaced him as the government's wheat experimentalist. Although he briefly entertained a 1902 offer from James Wilson, Head of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), to become the Chief of the Bureau of Tropical Agriculture in Manila, Cobb elected to stay on with the NSW Department of Agriculture. As their children approached university age, however, the Cobbs determined to move back to the United States and so Nathan spent a good portion of 1902-1904 corresponding with contacts and took leave in 1904 to visit his homeland.,  Cobb's efforts bore fruit when, in 1905, he completed negotiations to become the Director of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association's (HSPA) Division of Plants and Pathology. In the laboratory he personally designed at the HSPA Experiment Station, Cobb conducted considerable research into fungal and parasitic diseases (including nematode infestation) in sugarcane and other tropical fruits. He accepted this opening with a fixed term as he had made arrangements with the USDA for a position that would be ""more congenial"" to his overall interests to be held until his work in Hawaii was completed.,  In 1907, Nathan became an Agricultural Technologist with the USDA's Bureau of Plant Industry and the family moved east, eventually settling in Falls Church, Virginia. In the initial phase of his employment, much of Cobb's work dealt with the standardization of cotton grades and measurement of cotton staple. Although he was transferred to different research in 1915, he was awarded the following year a medal by the National Association of Cotton Manufacturers for his development of a patented method and apparatus to determine the length of cotton fibers. In his newly refocused role, Cobb investigated the economic impact of nematodes on agriculture and became a powerful advocate for the establishment of nematology as a distinct field of scientific inquiry and the formation of a separate division within the USDA devoted to this study. Indeed, his writings from 1912 onwards made a definitive case for the separation of nematology from helminthology and also established the standards for laboratory methodologies and techniques that would guide future generations of nematologists. By 1918 the USDA recognized his laboratory as the Bureau of Plant Industry's Division of Nematology and Cobb had become the government's chief nematologist.,  Although his active intellect found many outlets, much of the remainder of Cobb's life would be devoted to the study of nematodes (or 'nema' as he referred to them). He is widely regarded as the 'Father of Nematology' and the Society of Nematologists has named a foundation in his honor. In addition to his work within the government, Cobb produced a series of works known as ""Contributions to a Science of Nematology"", which, with their richly illustrated plates, form a basic reference in the field and is still consulted at the dawn of the twenty-first century.,  In his later years, Cobb became an avid birdwatcher and served as an officer of various scientific organizations, including the American Microscopical Society, the Helminthological Society of Washington, the American Society of Parasitology, and the Washington Academy of Science. Beyond his accomplishments as a plant pathologist and zoologist, Cobb held numerous patents related to cameras, microscopes, and other practical implements. Nathan A. Cobb died suddenly of a heart attack on June 4, 1932 while in Johns Hopkins Hospital for his annual medical evaluation. Margaret Vara Cobb helped complete his ""Key to the Genera of Free-Living Nematodes"" (published in 1935) and Frieda Cobb Blanchard wrote an extensive biography of her father that first appeared in the Asa Gray Bulletin in 1957 and has since proven an invaluable resource for subsequent biographers. Alice Vara Cobb survived her husband and lived until 1951. Her recollections of her early life with Nathan (collected by her daughter, Frieda Cobb Blanchard and title ""As I remember it..."") were invaluable in tracing their lives' paths.,  Frieda Cobb Blanchard was born in New South Wales, Australia in 1889 and she developed an aptitude for drawing and an interest in the scientific world at an early age. Having assisted her father in his home laboratories in Australia, she began to work with him at the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association Experiment Station after the family moved to Honolulu in 1905. She later completed high school in Washington, D.C. and attended Radcliffe College for three years before returning to Falls Church, Virginia to assist her father in his home laboratory. She eventually completed her B.S. in general science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1916. After studying nematodes with her father at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Frieda moved to Ann Arbor at the express request of Dr. Harley H. Bartlett (a Harvard classmate of her brother, Victor). In addition to pursuing graduate studies at the University of Michigan and working as Bartlett's graduate assistant, she was appointed Assistant Director of the University of Michigan's Botanical Gardens. She earned her Ph.D. in genetics in 1920 (studying Mendelian inheritance in evening primroses) and continued to work at the Botanical Gardens, serving as the active administrator during Bartlett's frequent research trips. In 1922, Frieda married herpetologist and Michigan professor Frank N. Blanchard with whom she had three children (Frank Nelson, Grace, and Dorothy) and collaborated professionally (achieving the first demonstration of Mendelian inheritance in reptiles). After Frank's unexpected death in 1937, Frieda raised the children on her own and continued her research and teaching activities as well as her work at the Botanical Gardens. Frieda Cobb Blanchard lived in Ann Arbor for the rest of her life and died in 1977.,  Frank Nelson Blanchard was born in 1888 in Stoneham, Massachusetts and in 1913 graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in biology. He taught zoology for three years (1913-1916) at the Massachusetts Agricultural College in Amherst before pursuing his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Michigan. In Ann Arbor, Frank studied under noted professor Alexander G. Ruthven; he wrote his dissertation on king snakes and received his doctorate in 1919. After working as an aide from 1918-1920 in the Smithsonian Institution's Division of Reptiles, he became a professor at the University of Michigan in 1920 and married Frieda Cobb in 1922. He performed extensive field research at the University of Michigan's Biological Station and across the U.S., often with Frieda, his students, and various collaborators such as Howard K. Gloyd. Although Blanchard was recognized as a leading authority on North American snakes, he devoted considerable research to salamanders and the life histories of both these species. Respected by his colleagues, Frank N. Blanchard was especially well-liked by his students; his unexpected passing in 1937 after a brief illness was much lamented at the University of Michigan and the herpetological world in general.,  Isaac Gray Blanchard, the paternal grandfather of Frank N. Blanchard, was born in Charlotte, Maine on October 29, 1819 and was the oldest of David and Saviah (Bennett) Blanchard's ten children. The family lived in a relatively unsettled part of Maine (18 miles from the town of Eastport) and David made his living as a farmer and tradesman. Isaac read extensively to supplement the somewhat limited education provided by the local school and by his teens he regularly submitted poetry and prose pieces to area newspapers (most notably the Eastport Sentinel). He continued to write poetry for the rest of his life (as well as fiction and, in his later years, an unfinished autobiography) and was a frequent contributor to newspaper editorial pages through his final years. As a young man, Blanchard had a three-year apprenticeship in the printing business at the Sentinel and in addition to working his father's farm and teaching in district schools, he served as the Town Clerk. During this time he also studied Pitman's phonography and taught this system of shorthand writing in lectures and correspondence courses. In 1849, he removed to Boston, worked as a typesetter for several publishers, and soon thereafter became an associate editor of a literary and scientific journal. By this time, Blanchard had married Margaret E. Johnson, with whom he had five children (including Charles Frederick Blanchard, the father of Frank N.), the eldest of whom was born in 1850. That same year he partnered with C. C. Tyler of Eastport to purchase the East Boston Ledger; he would run the paper for 12 years before poor health and scant profits forced him to sell out. Blanchard then graduated from Dio Lewis's Normal Institute for Physical Education in 1863 and was a ""New Gymnastics"" instructor before becoming the editor-in-chief of the Boston Daily Voice. Although he had long harbored progressive ideas, Blanchard's service with this cooperative newspaper precipitated his increased involvement in the nascent labor movement in the United States. He attended the second session of the National Labor Union in 1868, wrote extensively on labor issues and the inequalities of the capitalist system, contributed editorials to newspapers such as American Workman and The People's Paper, and in 1870 self-published a collection of labor songs under the title ""Rhymes for the Times."" After the Daily Voice failed, Blanchard tried (and failed) in a number of endeavors (one venture was destroyed in the great Boston fire of 1872) before moving to Clay County, Florida in 1877. In spite of the somewhat strained relations endemic to the post-Reconstruction South, Blanchard took an active role in his community: he raised a variety of crops (and helped charter a Farmers' Club in 1884); donated land for a public school and assembly hall in 1879; and taught a variety of subjects once the school was opened. Although he had been an early convert to Christianity and had lectured publicly on Millerism in his youth, Blanchard rejected formal religion in his young adulthood and instead grew increasingly interested in spiritualism. He wrote a series of articles in 1855 in the Eastport Sentinel on the manifest reality of spirits, was close with a number of mediums, and attended numerous s√©ances in both New England and Florida. Isaac Blanchard died on February 5, 1885 in Highlands, Florida. (Information in this biography was gleaned from George Bancroft Griffith's The Poets of Maine (1888)).","Blanchard family., Blanchard family."

He graduated from Grand Rapids High School in 1900 and studied for a year at the University of Michigan (1900-1901). Although he received numerous honorary law and other degrees later in life, this marked the end of his formal education.,  Vandenberg first started out to be a journalist and author. He dropped out of college in 1901 to work full-time at the Grand Rapids Herald, where as a young man he had worked as a copy boy. For a short time he worked at Collier's Weekly magazine in New York, but returned home in 1905 to marry Elizabeth Watson. In 1906, he went back to the Herald, becoming its editor, and after 1919, its financial manager as well. During this period, Vandenberg wrote three books: The Greatest American: Alexander Hamilton (1921), If Hamilton Were Here Today (1923), and The Trail of a Tradition (1926). He remained at the Herald until 1928 when he left for Washington and the U.S. Senate.,  In this first phase of his career, Vandenberg was both a newspaperman and a local political figure. He was a member of the Grand Rapids Charter Commission in 1910, a member of the Republican State Central Committee from 1912 to 1918, and chairman of the Republican State Convention in 1916 and 1928 In addition, the editorials he wrote, especially those relating to problems of local government, brought Vandenberg to the public's attention and he became a noteworthy figure in the state Republican party.,  In 1928, Vandenberg was appointed to fill a Republican vacancy on the U.S. Senate. He was elected in his own right that same year and then re-elected in 1934, 1940, and 1946. When he died in 1951, he was still in office. During the 72nd Congress Vandenberg was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills, during the 79th he was chairman of the Republican Conference, and during the 80th he was President pro tempore of the Senate and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Three times his name came up as a possibility for President of the United States, in 1936, 1940 and again in 1948, although he was never nominated to run.,  Although he had been a staunch isolationist, having opposed U.S. participation in the League of Nations during the 1930s, Vandenberg gradually converted his thinking to internationalism. In a speech he made to the Senate in January 1945, he committed himself to the idea of one world, stating that no nation could exist safely on its own and emphasizing that the United States had to be a leader in world affairs. After that speech, President Roosevelt named him a delegate to the charter conference for the United Nations, convened in San Francisco in 1945. Vandenberg also became a delegate to the first and second United Nations General Assemblies in London and New York in 1946. In 1947, he was a delegate to the Pan American Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He was actively involved in getting bipartisan support for U.S. ratification of the U.N. Charter in 1945; in winning the Senate's approval of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan; and in forming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, authoring the Vandenberg Resolution which was approved by the Senate in 1948.,  In 1906 Vandenberg married Elizabeth Watson, whom he had known for much of his life. Their three children were Arthur Jr., Barbara, and Elizabeth. She died in 1916 and Vandenberg married Hazel Whitaker in 1918. The second Mrs. Vandenberg died in 1950. The senator died of cancer on April 18, 1951, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Grand Rapids, his lifelong home.",Vandenberg family.

Ruthven was born April 1, 1882 in Hull, Iowa. He received his BS degree in 1903 from Morningside College and his Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Michigan. As a zoologist, Ruthven's major interest was in reptiles and amphibians - snakes, lizards turtles, frogs, etc. He wrote extensively in his disciple and also directed various scientific expeditions in North, South and Central America. Also, before assuming the presidency, Ruthven was chief field naturalist with the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey (1908-1912).,  Ruthven's entire career was spent at the University of Michigan where he was successively instructor of zoology and curator of the Museum of Zoology (1906-1911); assistant professor and curator of the Museum of Zoology (1911-1913); assistant professor and director of the Museum of Zoology (1913-1915); profess and director of the Museum of Zoology (1915-1929); director of University Museums (1922-1936); chairman of the department of zoology and director of the Zoological Laboratories (1927-1929); and dean of administration (1928-1929). Upon President Little's resignation, Ruthven was named to a committee of three to administer the affairs of the University. With administrative skills demonstrated in this position, Ruthven in October 1929 was selected by the regents as president of the University of Michigan. He served in this position until 1951 when Harlan Hatcher assumed office.,  Upon assuming office as president, Ruthven worked to reform the administrative structure of the university. He believed that the university must distribute authority and responsibility among the many units and officers which make up the total structure. Early on he selected two vice-presidents, one in charge of business affairs and the other in charge of educational investigations. He also appointed a director of plant extension, and some time later, a vice-president in charge of university relations outside the campus. In 1944, the university's administrative structure included a provost, two vice-presidents, and a secretary. Deans and directors of schools, colleges, and other educational units were given authority commensurate with their responsibilities. Usually, advisory or executive committees were set up to aid unit heads with their duties.,  During Ruthven's tenure, the School of Music was formally affiliated and integration with the university. In 1941, the School of Public Health was established; and in 1951, the School of Social Work was established. Other important developments during his tenure were the creation of an Institute of Public Administration and the reorganization of the School of Forestry as the School of Natural Resources.,  Ruthven died January 19, 1971.",Ruthven family.

NIS disseminates (to internal and external audiences) information about university programs, research, and activities of faculty and staff, primarily through the news media. NIS also responds to media requests for information about the university. Staff is comprised of information officers and editors covering specific university units, a photography unit, and a radio and television unit. This office also publishes The University Record, a weekly newspaper for faculty and staff, and Michigan Today, a quarterly tabloid newspaper sent to U-M alumni (complete sets of these publications are held by the Bentley Library). Some units on campus handle media relations through offices largely independent of NIS. These units include sports information, the Medical Center, the College of Engineering, Law School, and Business School.,  News and Information Services has undergone several name and organizational changes, but can trace its roots to 1897, when the Regents requested a plan for to disseminate University news to the State. This original department of information services was primarily responsible for publishing newsletters and frequently struggled to finance its operations. By 1930, the need for a news agency had grown, and following the installation of President Alexander G. Ruthven, the university created a News Dissemination Service (often called the University of Michigan News Service). Led by Wilfred B. Shaw, the Service had two primary functions. First, it was responsible for preparing weekly releases for nearly 800 newspapers throughout the state and beyond. This reporting included news about the Regents, research conducted by professors, affairs of the student body, and all other campus news with the exclusion of athletics. The second function was to send news about individual students to their home town papers. (Michigan Alumnus May 27, 1959).,  Originally part of the Bureau of Alumni Relations, in 1942 the University News Service, now led by Donald K. Anderson, became an independent department. In 1946, Arthur L. Brandon was appointed as the Director of Information Services and took over responsibility for the public information services on behalf of the University, services which included the University News Service, news photography, and promotional publications. In 1948, services expanded with the acquisition of the WUOM radio station and continued to adapt to new media with the addition of television.,  With the administrative changes resulting from the installment of President Harlan H. Hatcher, Brandon's title was changed to Director of University Relations and the University News Service became part of the Office of University Relations. Other changes followed, with Regents meetings being opened to the press in 1954 and University News Service taking on photographic coverage at athletic events in 1956. In 1957, Brandon resigned from his position and was replaced by Lyle M. Nelson. As Director of University Relations, Nelson combined radio and television under the director of broadcasting. Nelson retired in 1961 and was replaced by Michael Radock. One year later, administrative reorganization created an Information Service.,  The Information Service consisted of three divisions, including News Service, News Photography, and Community Relations. Further reorganization in 1963 and 1964 moved the publications and editorial services under the umbrella of Information Services and saw the promotion of Cleland B. Wyllie, who had been with the News Service since the 1940s, to Director of Media Relations.,  While the Office of University Relations underwent several changes and reorganizations in the following years, Information Services remained under its jurisdiction until 1998, when the office was divided into three vice presidential posts. One of these new posts was the Vice President for Media Relations, which was responsible for the University's News Service. In 2000, the Media Relations became the Office of the Vice President for Communications, which is where the current News Service resides in the University organization. News Service has continued to expand its media types and now includes podcasts, social media, and other online resources in addition to its print, radio, and television services.,  Current information about News and Information Services and on-line versions of the University Record and Michigan Today (with searchable back issues of the Record from September 1992, and Michigan Today from December 1993) is available on the Web at the following URL: http://ns.umich.edu/new/.",

His work in the field of bankruptcy over fifty years helped shape bankruptcy law and what was to become the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 through his involvement in many of the conferences and committees that drafted the legislation for congressional debate. He was a professor of bankruptcy law at the University of Iowa and at the University of Michigan. He taught bankruptcy law and related subjects at the University of Michigan from 1961 to 1984.,  Kennedy was born July 27, 1914, in Strafford, Missouri. He attended Southwest Missouri State University from 1931 to 1935 and received an A.B. and a teaching license. He received his law degree from Washington University School of Law, attending from 1936 to 1939. While at Washington University, he was first in his class all three years and was a member of the law review. It was while at Washington University that he took courses in secured transactions and debtor's estates. It was as a result of these classes that he decided to pursue his interests in bankruptcy and corporate reorganization. After completing his law degree, he received the Sterling Fellowship at Yale University Law School which allowed him to pursue a Juris Scientia Doctor (J.S.D), an advanced law degree. This was common practice at that time for those lawyers who wanted to become law professors. While at Yale, he was a prot√©g√© of J.W. Moore, a leading academician on Chapter X reorganization, and helped him revise Collier on Bankruptcy. Professor Moore also helped him gain membership to the National Bankruptcy Conference.,  World War II interrupted Kennedy's work on his J.S.D. thesis. He spent the war (1943-1946) in the Navy working as a personnel officer at the Naval Air Station, Quonset Point, Rhode Island. He became a law professor at the University of Iowa in 1940 and continued to work on his J.S.D. thesis which he successfully completed in 1953. He taught at the University of Iowa from 1940 to 1942 and 1946 to 1960. His primary subjects of instruction were: bankruptcy, secured transactions, creditor's rights, restitution, trade regulation, federal jurisdiction, and constitutional law.,  In addition to his academic career, he participated in the bankruptcy law profession as a member of committees and conferences whose mission it was to examine, supervise, and revise the bankruptcy laws and procedural bankruptcy rules of the United States. In this role, he has served as a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference (NBC) since 1947. The purpose of the NBC is to study bankruptcy case administration and develop needed amendments when requested by the United States House and Senate Judiciary Committees. As a member of the NBC he has acted as chairman of the Drafting Committee and member of the executive committee, 1959 and as secretary, 1981-1990. In 1959 he was also invited to become the reporter for the first Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States (ACBR), of which he was a member from 1960 to 1976. The ACBR was formed to draft rules of procedure for bankruptcy courts. This included drafting a statute that authorized the Supreme Court to promulgate procedural rules even if they conflicted with the existing Bankruptcy Act, an unusual grant of powers considering the separation of powers under the Constitution. This authority was later removed by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Professor Kennedy was appointed executive director of the Commission on Bankruptcy Laws (CBL) in 1970. The CBL was authorized by Congress to study the current bankruptcy laws and process. The CBL grew out of a long-standing issue in the legal community regarding the status of bankruptcy courts and whether the bankruptcy process should be an administrative rather than a judicial procedure. It held hearings all over the country regarding issues in bankruptcy law. In 1973, the CBL produced bankruptcy legislation to propose to Congress. Although the legislation did not pass that year, it helped to lay the foundation for the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.,  Professor Kennedy's relationship with the University of Michigan began in 1958 when he was a visiting professor. The university was looking for a professor in bankruptcy and reorganization after the death of professor Edgar Durfee, and Michigan persuaded him to return. He returned as a permanent professor in 1961, and remained at the university until 1984 when he was given emeritus status. He came to Michigan because of the opportunity to dedicate more of his teaching and scholarly time to bankruptcy-related issues. While at Michigan he taught creditor's rights, bankruptcy, reorganization, secured transactions, and consumer credit. He received the Distinguished Faculty Achievement award in 1971. He was named the Thomas M. Cooley Professor of Law in 1979. Over time he has contributed prodigious scholarship to the field of bankruptcy law by having almost 170 articles published in law reviews or contributed to legal treatises. In 1997 he was recognized for fifty years of membership in the Association of American University Professors.,  He also served as Of Counsel to Sidley & Austin in Chicago, IL from 1983 to 1994. His civic involvement includes membership in the Ann Arbor Rotary Club where he served as president from 1979 to 1980.",

On January 14, 1924 a federal license was issued, authorizing the university to operate station WCBC on 1,070 kilocycles, with 200 watts of power for unlimited time. However, the equipment was experimental and proved inefficient for more than periodic transmission. Consequently, the department submitted to the regents a request for $20,000 to build a more professional station, and a yearly appropriation of $3000 to maintain it. However, the regents, believing that the university's broadcasting program could be carried out with less expense through the cooperation of a commercial station which had an established audience, refused the request. As a result, when the station's license expired in June 1925, no application for renewal was filed, and the station's privilege was canceled in October.,  Lack of administrative support for funding did not mean lack of support for radio broadcasting. In the same year that WCBC's license was allowed to lapse, the regents established the University of Michigan Broadcasting Service (UMBS) and appointed Waldo Abbot, then instructor in rhetoric in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, as director of the Broadcasting Service, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1957. During the 1925-26 academic year arrangements were made with Detroit radio station WJR for the regular broadcasting of programs originating on the campus, chiefly talks presented by faculty and musical programs by School of Music students and organizations.,  The first of these ""Michigan Night"" programs featured University President Clarence Cook Little, who, in his remarks set forth the broadcasting mission of the university: ""to give to the former students, alumni and alumnae, a few reminders of the spirit of the campus [and] to give to the citizens of the State entertainment and a brief opportunity to become acquainted with certain of the policies which are shaping the efforts [of the university] to serve the State as wisely and as widely as we can."" [1],  In 1933 UMBS became a unit of the Extension Division. Though Abbot continued as director of the Broadcasting Service, he was transferred from the Department of English Language and Literature to the Department of Speech and General Linguistics, in which he instituted courses in radio speech, dramatics, and writing. These were ""hands-on"" courses that provided students with both ""on-air"" and ""behind-the-scenes"" broadcasting experience. The functions of the Broadcasting Service were increased to include class instruction, the recording of speech for students and for faculty research, and the making of recordings to be used by University of Michigan alumni clubs.[2] Radio programming throughout the 1930s and 1940s would consist of music instruction, art and vocational guidance to schools, and a host of adult programs featuring the academic and cultural resources of the university.,  One of the first educational institutions to recognize the potential in FM broadcasting--a technological marvel first demonstrated at the 1939 New York World's Fair--the University of Michigan applied for authorization to build a non-commercial frequency modulation station in 1943. Although the FCC granted the permit in 1944, construction was delayed until after World War II, and it wasn't until July 1, 1948 that station WUOM made its debut. Since 1928 UMBS had operated out of a small studio located in Morris Hall. When Morris Hall was torn down to make room for a new administration building (now the Literature, Science and Arts Building) in 1945, UMBS moved into temporary quarters in Angell Hall, while awaiting construction of a ""state of the art"" facility that was to dominate the fifth floor of the new building.,  When it first went on the air in 1948, WUOM offered a daily broadcast schedule of forty to fifty hours per week, with scheduled programming from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Then, as now, the largest percentage of this programming consisted of music: faculty chamber music recitals, regular rehearsals of the University Choir and the Symphony Orchestra, an ""informal program of music appreciation"" hosted by Wiley Hitchcock, and recorded classical music. But the new station did not abandon its commitment to sharing the university's cultural and academic resources; rather, it also offered a fairly diverse schedule of radio plays performed, and often written, by the Radio Guild and students in the Department of Speech, a children's story program, foreign language programs, and talks by university faculty.,  By 1949, when WUOM finally moved into its new studios, Waldo Abbot could boast that ""at the present [the station is] on the air fifty-five hours a week, devoting fifty percent of its time to transcribed and recorded musical programs. Eleven percent [is] live music presented by faculty, students, and organizations connected with the University's School of Music. Ten percent [is] programs in which students participate, such as dramatic programs, round tables, campus news, etc. Sixteen percent [are] presented by members of the university faculties, either in talks, round tables, interviews, or quiz programs. Six percent is devoted to sports and seven percent to public service programs from off-campus sources.""[3] That fall, WUOM introduced ""Treasures Off the Shelf,"" an original dramatic series based upon manuscript materials in the university's Clements Library. This series, the first of many such series WUOM would produce over the next twenty years, not only proved popular with listeners, but received a First Award from the Institute for Education by Radio.,  Prior to 1950 the focus of WUOM programming had been on adult education and enrichment. That fall, however, the station inaugurated the Radio Classroom, through which it offered the university's academic and cultural resources to school systems throughout the state of Michigan. The first--and longest running--of the Radio Classroom series was ""Festival of Song,"" a program of music instruction and singing lessons designed to enhance the classroom experience of every child. Though the series was first limited to schools in Washtenaw County, response was so positive that by 1952 Radio Classroom series were being carried, either via direct relay or distributed programming, by sixteen stations state-wide, including the Upper Peninsula. When WUOM celebrated its tenth anniversary on July 5, 1958, President Harlan H. Hatcher enthusiastically cited the station's efforts to ""extend the important educational resources of the University to an ever-increasing audience ranging from pre-school youngsters to senior adult citizens... Through the maintenance of professional standards and the recognition of radio as serious art, educational broadcasters have made an important contribution to modern methods of communication. We are confident that the next decade will see the leadership of educational broadcasting extended, and the service of the University's own WUOM to the people of the State of Michigan enriched and expanded.""[4],  The next decade did indeed see an extension of both leadership and service by WUOM, as well as significant changes in how that service was carried out. In 1961 WUOM received FCC permission to construct an FM station in West Michigan, in order to relay WUOM programming to the metropolitan areas of Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, and Muskegon. WVGR began broadcasting on December 2 of that same year. Though WUOM had always been closely affiliated with the National Association of Educational Broadcasting and its affiliate, National Educational Radio, the 1960s saw an increase in staff involvement. Particularly significant is the role played by station manager Edgar Burrows whose tenure as NAEB chairman encompassed the critical Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as well as the controversy concerning copyright law revision, and NAEB's 1967 reorganizational study.,  Though still responsive to its listeners' preferences for classical music programming, and still committed to its long-standing policy of extending the University's academic and cultural resources to the people of the State of Michigan, in 1960 the station began to increase its emphasis on news reporting and analysis, as well as on broadcasting more of the issues-oriented public lectures and panel discussions held on campus. By 1969 WUOM felt that local, national, and international events were requiring them to spend more time ""interpreting the proper role of the University to the general public, explaining and analyzing the nature of internal conflicts in the light of national and international events, and bringing to the University community itself as balanced and detailed a reporting of events on and off campus as possible.""[5] Consequently, long-time musical program favorites like The Record Collector, Afternoon Musicale, and Music of the Masters increasingly shared the broadcast schedule with protest rallies, teach-ins and sit-ins, and special sessions of the University Senate.,  Subsequent decades have brought even more changes to WUOM--new network affiliation, rapidly changing technologies, budget uncertainties, personnel and leadership turnovers--all of which have, in some way, influenced station operation and programming. Nevertheless the station remains faithful to the mission established in the 1940s by the University Executive Committee on Radio, to ""interpret and report to its audience the various activities of the University with emphasis upon education, research, and training with the intent to develop a broader knowledge, a fuller understanding and deeper appreciation of the humanities, of the sciences, and of social, economic, and civic problems [as well as offering] entertainment consistent with the policies and practices of an institution of higher learning.""[6],  ___________________________,  1--Radio Programs Given at the University of Michigan During the Year 1925-1926, Printed Materials, box 34, WUOM, Bentley Historical Library (BHL).,  2--""A Report on Radio Broadcasting at the University of Michigan"", 1943, Annual and miscellaneous reports, 1933-1945, box 32.,  3--""WUOM of the University of Michigan,"" Collins Radio Company, Cedar Rapids, Iowa [1949?], Printed Materials, box 32.,  4--WUOM Program Schedule, October 1958, Printed Materials, box 32.,  5--University of Michigan Broadcasting Service - Radio WUOM/WVGR Annual Report, 1968-70, Printed Materials, box 32.,  6--University of Michigan Broadcasting Service - Radio Station WUOM [By-laws], Executive Committee on Radio, 1947-1948, box 2.",

Their common goals were to support the struggles of Latin American peoples against repressive and authoritarian political regimes, and to encourage the establishment of democratic government in Latin American countries. To this end, the committee endeavored to increase awareness of contemporary political and social realities in Latin America, and to pressure the United States government to change its military, political, and economic policies with regard to the region.,  Predecessor and, to a certain extent, parent to the Latin American Solidarity Committee was the radical, Boston-based Science for the People. The group's interests centered on the political aspects of science, and the effects of science on the lives of people around the world. The Ann Arbor chapter of Science for the People was formed in 1974 by seven graduate students and faculty in biology at the University of Michigan. A central figure in the organization and activities of the chapter was Biology Professor John Vandermeer.,  The activities of the Ann Arbor chapter of Science for the People took place on three levels. First, the group was involved in national-level discussions of issues, and provided ideas for the organization of Science for the People at the national level. ""Internal Discussion Bulletins"" and National Conferences were the major forum for this exchange of ideas. Second, the chapter was involved in activities at the regional level. These included participating in midwest regional conferences, sitting on regional coordinating committees and editorial collectives, as well as producing special issues of the national magazine, Science for the People. Third, the chapter sponsored activities locally. Activity groups were formed to discuss and analyze specific issues/topics in science and technology (e.g.--sexism in science, nuclear policy, and recombinant DNA) and to act on these analyses, if they felt so compelled. Other local activities included general meetings, a film series, and a 1976 Symposium on Biological Determinism, which spawned a mini-course and a book entitled Biology as a Social Weapon (available at the University of Michigan Natural Sciences Library).,  One of the more active groups in Science for the People was the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) Support Group. Formed as a Science for the People activity group in 1977, the FLOC Support Group became semi-autonomous and aligned its activities with those of the national FLOC organization, based in Toledo, Ohio. The Ann Arbor group was started with the idea that the resources of the University of Michigan could be used to help FLOC start a migrant workers' health clinic and to aid in FLOC's corporate relations. However, most of the group's activity involved becoming familiar with the plight of migrant farmworkers in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, and providing practical support for the Toledo organization mainly through the use of publicity. The Ann Arbor group was primarily interested in the use of pesticides and their effects on the health of farm workers, and they helped produce pamphlets which served to inform the workers of the potential dangers of pesticides.,  Both the University of Michigan Science for the People chapter and the FLOC Support Group actively participated in a nationwide boycott of the Campbell Soup and Libby's companies beginning in 1979. The boycott was a response to the companies' apparent failure to recognize the rights of farmworkers to engage in collective bargaining. The boycott persisted until 1986, when FLOC's Toledo office reached a contract agreement with the companies.,  After 1986, the two local groups became moribund. L.A.S.C., which grew out of their activities and co-existed with them for several years, continues to be active.",

However, from the time he entered the University of Michigan as an undergraduate, his life and work were closely tied to Michigan. As a student, Hutchins was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and an editor of the University Chronicle. He was the first student to receive a degree from James B. Angell in 1871, and upon graduation worked for a year as superintendent of the Owosso schools. Hutchins returned to the university as an instructor in rhetoric and history and became an assistant professor a year later. During the three years he held that post, he studied law and began practicing law in Mount Clemens in 1876. , On December 27, 1872, Harry B. Hutchins married Marry Louise Crocker, of Birmingham, Michigan. Mary was born on January 14, 1857, the daughter of Fandira Emery Crocker and Thomas Martin Crocker. She was a descendent of Thomas Hooker, founder of Hartford, Connecticut, and Deacon William Crocker, one of the early settlers of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Mrs. Hutchins graduated from Mt. Clemens High School in 1869. , In 1884, Mr. Hutchins returned to the University of Michigan as Jay Professor of Law. His teaching and organizational skills were recognized by Cornell University which invited him to organize its law school in 1887. He later returned to Ann Arbor and was appointed dean of the University of Michigan's Department of Law in 1895. He served as interim president of the university in 1897-98 while President Angell was serving as envoy to Turkey, and again in 1909-10 after Angell's resignation. In spite of Hutchins reluctance to accept the appointment as president at age 63, the Regents prevailed upon him, and he agreed to serve for five years. Letters of July 5, 1910, to Regents Leland and Knappen (box 2, folder 1) detail the conditions of his acceptance; numerous letters in the next few months replying to congratulatory messages he received, reiterate his doubts and hesitation. However, once in office he applied himself to the job with diligence. Hutchins believed that the university should be a leader and a contributor to the public good. Toward that end, he travelled extensively in his first year in office lecturing and meeting with alumni to encourage their support of the university by establishing active regional alumni organizations. He also oversaw the beginnings of an extension service to better serve the people of the Michigan. At first only a kind of speakers' bureau, which arranged for university professors to lecture to various groups outstate, it later added courses in outlying localities for which university credit could be earned., President Hutchins took a personal interest in students, often inviting them to call on him, but he was also a strict disciplinarian who held students to a high standard of academic work and personal morality. His term in office was extended beyond five years by the demands of World War I, and he served until 1920., Mr. and Mrs. Hutchins hosted many friends and distinguished guests, including U.S. President William H. Taft, to their home in Ann Arbor and their summer cottage in Cotuit, Massachusetts. Mary Hutchins was a member of many organizations including the Daughters of the American Revolution, a Regent of the Sarah Caswell Angell Chapter, the National Committee for the American flag, the Michigan Chapter of Colonial Dames, the American Association of University Women (Ann Arbor branch), the Faculty Women's Club, and a founding member of the Ann Arbor Women's Club. Mary Hutchins died of a heart attack on August 2, 1927. , After his retirement in 1920, Hutchins became President Emeritus and continued to serve the university in various capacities until his death. Harry B. Hutchins died on January 25, 1930.",Hutchins family.

On June 19, 1982, while at a club in Detroit for his bachelor party, Chin encountered Ronald Ebens, a Detroit autoworker. According to reports, Ebens verbally harassed Chin, blaming his race for recent U.S. automotive unemployment (mistakenly believing Chin to be Japanese). A fight between the two men broke out, Chin striking Ebens before the men were separated. Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz, later deliberately tracked down Chin and attacked him with a baseball bat in front of a fast-food restaurant. Injuries from the attack led to Chin's death four days later.,  Outraged by a judge's lenient sentence for these two men: a $3000 fine and 3 years probation, a group of Asian Pacific Americans formed the American Citizens for Justice on March 30, 1983, with the immediate goal of fighting for a retrial. Consisting of individuals of wide-ranging Asian descent including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino, this group represented for the ""first time, according to APA advocates and academics, that people who trace their ancestry to different countries in Asia and the Pacific Islands crossed ethnic and socioeconomic lines to fight as a united group of Asian Pacific Americans"" (http://www.asianweek.com/061397/feature.html, para. 9). Working with other Asian Pacific American groups, the ACJ gathered support, ""staged rallies, organized demonstrations, and launched a massive letter-writing campaign"" (para. 23) all in hopes of bringing Chin's killers to justice. In 1984, the two men were brought to trial and Ebens was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. However, this ruling was later overturned due to a legal technicality. In a 1987 retrial, Ebens and Nitz were found not guilty on all charges.,  The goals of the American Citizens for Justice have extended since the Chin incident, moving beyond the trial to broader aims of educating the public about Asian-American discrimination and helping other victims of racial harassment and injustice. The ACJ advocates for Asian-Pacific Americans in several areas, including law enforcement, legislation, networking, education, and health (ACJ brochure). In addition to offering free legal consultation to victims of racial harassment and discrimination, the ACJ also collaborates with other attorneys and legal groups to monitor and provide advice for anti-Asian incidents throughout the country. Through petitions and letter-writing, the ACJ ""works to influence public policy and public institutions for just treatment of APAs"" (ACJ brochure). Additionally, the ACJ has been fully involved in public education, sponsoring several workshops and conferences, educating students and others on Asian-American discrimination and culture. Throughout its existence, the ACJ has also been involved in many different projects. In 1989, with a grant from the Michigan Department of Public Health, the ACJ conducted a health needs assessment survey of the Southeast Asian communities of Detroit. The ACJ is still in existence today and continues to advocate for Asian Americans.",

While a student, he held two jobs: one as city editor of the Michigan Daily, the other working for the Detroit Free Press. Swinton also wrote short stories and won the prestigious Hopwood award. On graduation day, he attended the ceremonies in the morning and began working as an editor for the Associated Press that very afternoon. At the onset of World War II, he took military leave and worked as a front-line combat correspondent in North Africa, Italy, and southern France, writing for the Stars and Stripes, a newspaper published for American GI's overseas. After the war, he continued his work as an AP correspondent. In 1947-1948, he was named chief of bureau for Southeast Asia and in 1948-1950 for the Middle East.

In 1884, his older brother and sister paid his expenses to the University of Michigan where he majored in zoology and came under the influence of Joseph B. Steere, chair of the Department of Zoology. In 1887, still an undergraduate, Worcester joined Steer's expedition to the Philippines, financing the costs by insuring his life and borrowing on the policy.,  The Steere expedition was recognized as a scientific success. With academic credit for his participation in the expedition and a semester's work in zoology, Worcester obtained his A.B. degree in 1889. He and Frank Bourns, also of the Steere expedition, planned a longer sojourn in the Philippines and found financing through the University of Minnesota and a wealthy Minneapolis businessman Louis F. Menage. The Menage Expedition, 1890-1893, resulted in the collection of over three thousand specimens of birds, bats, butterflies, reptiles, mammals, corals, shells and in ethnological material. Upon his return, Worcester married Nanon Fay Leas and in the autumn of 1893 became an instructor in animal morphology at the University of Michigan. He began publishing monographs on Philippine birds, with Bourns and alone, and in 1895 he was promoted to assistant professor of zoology and appointed curator of the Zoological Museum.,  In 1897 Worcester delivered his first general public lecture on the Philippines to the Unity Club of Ann Arbor and in that same year published his first general article on the Philippines, ""Spanish Rule in the Philippines, co-authored with Bourns. With Dewey's victory over the Spanish in Manila Bay (May 1, 1898), Worcester began to think of the exciting prospect of the Philippines as an American colony. During a six week period, July 10 to September 1, 1898, Worcester wrote a very successful book The Philippine Islands and Their People, based on the letters he had written home during his scientific expeditions. A few months later, and as the McKinley government moved to extend American military control over the Philippine archipelago, a letter from his expedition colleague Frank Bourns warning of the danger of a Philippine insurgency led him to seek a meeting with President McKinley at which time he presented Bourns' views and augmented them with his own. McKinley asked Worcester to join a ""civilian commission composed of men skilled in diplomacy and statesmanship"" as requested by Admiral Dewey who was alarmed at the rejection by the newly declared Filipino government of the U.S. program of benevolent assimilation.,  Through his participation in both the First and Second Philippine Commissions and in his position of Secretary of the Interior in the Commission government from 1901 to 1913, Worcester continued to have great influence on the formulation and implementation of American policy in the Philippines. His tenure on the First and Second Philippine Commissions would be the longest of all the commissioners. Worcester's rejection of independence for the Philippines, first voiced in an 1899 interview with Dr. Apacible, a Philippine insurgent with whom Worcester met in Hong Kong on his voyage to the Philippines, would never waver.,  In 1913 Worcester resigned his position with the Philippine Commission to become vice-president of the Philippine-American Company. The following year he published The Philippines Past and Present and continued to direct various business enterprises until his death. Worcester's influence on American colonial policy and the various and controversial roles he played in the Philippines from his first visit in 1887 to his death in Manila in 1924: scientist, government official, propagandist and entrepreneur, earned him both accolades and deep resentment.",

Chapin, Jr., the son of one of the founders of the Hudson Motor Car Company, was born September 21, 1915. After graduation from Yale in 1937, he joined the firm working as an experimental engineer. He expanded his interest in mechanics and worked in key automotive areas in production planning, accounting, manufacturing, car distribution, then in sales administration and field sales, becoming assistant sales manager in 1952.,  In 1954, when Hudson and Nash-Kelvinator merged to form the American Motors Corporation, Chapin became assistant treasurer. He became treasurer in 1955 and was elected vice president 1956. That same year he was named executive vice president. In 1960, he was elected executive vice president - international operations. He was elevated to executive vice president and general manager of the automotive division in September 1966. In 1967, he was named chairman and chief executive officer. He served in this capacity until 1977. He remained a member of the board of directors until 1987 when Chrysler acquired the company.,  Under his leadership, American Motors prospered, mainly because of its international operation and the success of its compact cars during the period of rising oil prices. In 1970, Chapin was instrumental in purchasing for American Motors the Jeep Corp. from Kaiser Industries.

Papers document his public career and aspects of his personal and family life and include correspondence, subject files, staff files, speeches, press releases and news clippings, photographs, sound recordings, films and videotapes.",The materials are in English.,"The G. Mennen Williams Papers consist of official and personal files arranged into six subgroups: 1) Gubernatorial papers, 1949-1960 (681 linear ft.); 2) Non-gubernatorial papers, 1883-1948 and 1958-1988 (107 linear ft.); 3) Visual materials, ca. 1911-1988 (ca. 25 linear ft.); 4) sound recordings, 1950-ca. 1988 (5 linear ft.) Scrapbooks, 1948-1987 (43 vols.) and State Department Microfilm, 1961-1966 (23 reels).,  As part of its own control system, the governor's office maintained a card index to the correspondents in many of the subgroups and series within the gubernatorial papers. This card file is located in the library's reading room. In addition, Nancy Williams and her staff compiled an extensive and detailed run of scrapbooks covering the Williams years. There is a separate inventory to these scrapbooks in a separately bound volume.,  Strategy for Use of the Gubernatorial Papers: Although the Williams gubernatorial collection consists of hundreds of linear feet of material, the file arrangement created by the governor's staff is a fairly simple one to understand and to use.,  The bulk of the collection falls within specific functional groupings, corresponding to the various activities and responsibilities that Williams performed as governor. Thus, if the researcher is uncertain of what portions of the collection might be relevant to his/her research, he/she is advised to think in terms of gubernatorial function. Does the proposed research concern the workings or area responsibility of a state board? If so, the Boards and Commissions series would be the most likely place in which to find material. The election of 1954? Then Democratic Party/Campaign Papers should be first choice. The passage of a specific piece of legislation? Here, Legislative Files is an obvious choice. The possible choices (called subgroups and series) that the researcher has are listed in the Organization of the Collection section. A description of the contents of each of these subgroups/series is provided below.,  If, at first, unsuccessful in finding material on any given topic, the researcher might consider these additional strategies:,  1. Refer to the Williams card index (located in the library's reading room). Sometimes, the name of an individual associated with a subject provides the easiest point of access into the collection. This file is arranged alphabetically and lists the dates of letters between an individual and the governor's office. This file only indexes the larger series and subgroups in the collection. It does not index the staff files, or parts of the Democratic Party/Campaign subgroup. Nevertheless it is an invaluable tool, and can uncover important material otherwise buried.,  2. Refer to the various series of staff papers. Staff members were often closely involved in a specific subject areas (Jordan Popkin and aging, for example) and thus their files are frequently rich in source material.,  3. If only partially successful in locating desired material, the researcher should think of an alternative subgroup or series. The governor's office, for a variety of reasons, often filed related material in different locations depending upon the source of a document. Thus, information relating to a strike might be filed both under the Labor Mediation Board in Boards and Commissions, and Strikes in General Subjects. Furthermore, if the strike influenced a specific piece of legislation, there could be material in the Legislative Files.","Judges -- Michigan., Governors -- Michigan., Political elections., Politics and government -- 1946-1960., Politics and government -- 1961-1970., Governors -- Michigan., Elections -- Michigan -- 1950., Elections -- Michigan -- 1952., Elections -- Michigan -- 1954., Elections -- Michigan -- 1956., Elections -- Michigan -- 1958., Elections -- Michigan -- 1960., Elections -- Michigan -- 1966., Governors -- Michigan.","Caricatures., Drawings., Motion pictures., Photographs., Tintypes., Scrapbooks., Sound recordings., Videotapes.","Africa., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1946-1960., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1961-1970., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1971-1980., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1981-1990., Philippines -- History -- 1946-1986., United States -- Foreign relations -- Africa., United States -- Foreign relations -- Philippines., United States -- Politics and government -- 1945-1989., Africa., Mackinac Bridge (Mich.), Philippines -- History -- 1946-1986., Africa -- Foreign relations -- United States., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1946-1960., Michigan -- Politics and government -- 1961-1970., Philippines -- Foreign relations -- United States., United States -- Foreign relations -- Africa., United States -- Foreign relations -- Philippines.","Williams, G.

Mennen Williams was a man born to privilege but who devoted his life to public service. His career included stints as governor of Michigan from 1949 to 1960, under-secretary of state for African Affairs from 1961 to 1965, and Michigan Supreme Court justice from 1970 to 1986. Williams was born in Detroit, February 23, 1911, to Henry P. and Elma Mennen Williams. After prepping at the Salisbury School in Connecticut, he received his AB degree at Princeton in 1933. Williams finished his formal education by taking a JD degree from the University of Michigan in 1936.,  Williams began his career as an attorney for the Social Security Board in Washington, D. C. In 1938 he returned to Michigan to serve as assistant attorney general under Raymond Starr. His public career took him back to Washington where he acted as executive assistant to United States Attorney General Frank Murphy, from 1939 to 1940. He continued to work for Murphy until 1941 as special assistant in the Criminal Division.,  With American entry into World War II, Williams' public service took a new form. Despite being thirty-one years old and the father of a young son, Williams sought and gained a commission as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He saw active duty as an air combat intelligence officer in the Pacific theater. After his discharge in 1946, Williams served as deputy director of the Office of Price Administration for Michigan until 1947. He then took a position as the Democratic member of the Michigan Liquor Control Commission and used this post to build a network of supporters for his gubernatorial campaign in 1948.,  Williams was elected governor of Michigan on the Democratic ticket in November 1948. The result was something of an upset in that Michigan was a strongly Republican state. Williams continued to upset Michigan Republicans, narrowly winning re-election in 1950, then winning the 1952, 1954, 1956, and 1958 elections. His re-election in 1958 gave him an unprecedented sixth consecutive term.,  By not running for state office in 1960, Williams left himself available to serve the nation as a whole. At one time thought to be under consideration for the vice-presidency, Williams was eventually tapped by President Kennedy to serve as undersecretary of state for African Affairs. Williams held this post until 1966 when he decided to campaign for the U.S. Senate; he lost to Robert Griffin. Williams returned to the public sphere when President Johnson appointed him ambassador to the Philippines in 1967. He held this post until Richard Nixon became president in January 1969.,  Williams resumed his career of public service to the state of Michigan by winning election to the State Supreme Court in 1970. He headed a reform movement within the judiciary to make administration of justice ""effective and efficient."" He served so capably during his first term that he was easily re-elected in 1978 and was elected Chief Justice by his peers in April 1983. Williams retired from the bench in 1987 and died February 2, 1988. He was survived by his wife, Nancy Quirk Williams, and three children, Gery, Nancy, and Wendy.",Williams family.

NIS disseminates (to internal and external audiences) information about university programs, research, and activities of faculty and staff, primarily through the news media. NIS also responds to media requests for information about the university. Staff is comprised of information officers and editors covering specific university units, a photography unit, and a radio and television unit. This office also publishes The University Record, a weekly newspaper for faculty and staff, and Michigan Today, a quarterly tabloid newspaper sent to U-M alumni (complete sets of these publications are held by the Bentley Library). Some units on campus handle media relations through offices largely independent of NIS. These units include sports information, the Medical Center, the College of Engineering, Law School, and Business School.,  News and Information Services has undergone several name and organizational changes, but can trace its roots to 1897, when the Regents requested a plan for to disseminate University news to the State. This original department of information services was primarily responsible for publishing newsletters and frequently struggled to finance its operations. By 1930, the need for a news agency had grown, and following the installation of President Alexander G. Ruthven, the university created a News Dissemination Service (often called the University of Michigan News Service). Led by Wilfred B. Shaw, the Service had two primary functions. First, it was responsible for preparing weekly releases for nearly 800 newspapers throughout the state and beyond. This reporting included news about the Regents, research conducted by professors, affairs of the student body, and all other campus news with the exclusion of athletics. The second function was to send news about individual students to their home town papers. (Michigan Alumnus May 27, 1959).,  Originally part of the Bureau of Alumni Relations, in 1942 the University News Service, now led by Donald K. Anderson, became an independent department. In 1946, Arthur L. Brandon was appointed as the Director of Information Services and took over responsibility for the public information services on behalf of the University, services which included the University News Service, news photography, and promotional publications. In 1948, services expanded with the acquisition of the WUOM radio station and continued to adapt to new media with the addition of television.,  With the administrative changes resulting from the installment of President Harlan H. Hatcher, Brandon's title was changed to Director of University Relations and the University News Service became part of the Office of University Relations. Other changes followed, with Regents meetings being opened to the press in 1954 and University News Service taking on photographic coverage at athletic events in 1956. In 1957, Brandon resigned from his position and was replaced by Lyle M. Nelson. As Director of University Relations, Nelson combined radio and television under the director of broadcasting. Nelson retired in 1961 and was replaced by Michael Radock. One year later, administrative reorganization created an Information Service.,  The Information Service consisted of three divisions, including News Service, News Photography, and Community Relations. Further reorganization in 1963 and 1964 moved the publications and editorial services under the umbrella of Information Services and saw the promotion of Cleland B. Wyllie, who had been with the News Service since the 1940s, to Director of Media Relations.,  While the Office of University Relations underwent several changes and reorganizations in the following years, Information Services remained under its jurisdiction until 1998, when the office was divided into three vice presidential posts. One of these new posts was the Vice President for Media Relations, which was responsible for the University's News Service. In 2000, the Media Relations became the Office of the Vice President for Communications, which is where the current News Service resides in the University organization. News Service has continued to expand its media types and now includes podcasts, social media, and other online resources in addition to its print, radio, and television services.,  Current information about News and Information Services and on-line versions of the University Record and Michigan Today (with searchable back issues of the Record from September 1992, and Michigan Today from December 1993) is available on the Web at the following URL: http://ns.umich.edu/new/.",

After contracting typhoid and not completely recovered, he was sent to Corregidor Island where his unit was building a convalescent hospital. Still a patient, Schneidewind was given light duties. He remained on the sick list until his discharge from the service in July 1899.,  After his discharge Schneidewind stayed in the Philippines and married Gabina Dionicio R. y Gabriel in 1900. Gabina died in 1901 giving birth to their son Richard, who later became Professor of Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Michigan.,  After Gabina's death Schneidewind returned to the U.S. In 1904 he worked at the St. Louis World's Fair where, among similar exhibits, he saw the ""Igorot Village"" exhibit that included 123 Igorots brought by the Dr. Truman K.

He graduated from Pendleton High School and attended the University of Oregon, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1938. He enrolled in the University of Michigan Medical School, earning his medical degree in 1940, and completing his internship and residency training in internal medicine.,  Following service with the Navy during World War II, he returned to Ann Arbor in 1946 and joined the Department of Internal Medicine as an instructor and helped to develop the Anticoagulation Clinic. Rheumatology was his primary interest, and in 1953 he was promoted to associate professor and placed in charge of the Rackham Arthritis Research Unit. He was promoted to the rank of professor in 1960.,  During the 1960s he took part in several epidemiologic investigations of rheumatic diseases, including the School of Public Health's Community Health Study at Tecumseh, Michigan, under the direction of Thomas Francis. In 1964 he began a lengthy association with the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC), studying the occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis among the populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. His studies extended to research on rheumatic diseases throughout the Far East, including Australia, China, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand, and the Philippines.,  In 1969, he became chief of the University of Michigan Arthritis Division and served as director of the Regional Arthritis Control Program from 1969 to 1971. He directed the Pilot Geriatric Arthritis Center from 1974 until 1977, when he was asked to establish a comprehensive health care program focusing on the special needs of the elderly.

Cole began tinkering with motors, electricity and other mechanical devices from a young age.  After a year at Grand Rapids Junior College, in 1930 he transferred to the General Motors Institute in Flint, a cooperative education program General Motors (GM) used to develop engineers and managers. While in school, Cole demonstrated clear engineering aptitude and went on to begin his professional career in the Cadillac Division of the company. , Cole quickly rose through the ranks at Cadillac and during World War II was named Chief Design Engineer for light tanks and combat vehicles. After the war,  he was named Chief Engineer (1946) and Works Manager (1950) at Cadillac and was responsible for overseeing operations at the Cadillac light tank factory in Cleveland during the Korean War. In 1952, Cole was named Chief Engineer at Chevrolet and in 1956 became the General Manager of Chevrolet and a Vice-President of General Motors. , While at Chevrolet, Cole was responsible for many significant innovations that shaped the automobile industry. He was member of the team that developed the first Corvette sports car and is known as the ""father"" of  the Chevy small block V8 engine. The engine was a major technological advancement due to it's small size, power and affordable production and continues to influence automotive engineering today. Cole was named to the Board of Directors of General Motors in 1961., One Cole's most significant projects as general manager of Chevrolet was the development of the Chevrolet Corvair, the company's first entrance into the burgeoning ""compact car"" market. Released in 1960, the Corvair was an early commercial success and lauded for its engineering and design innovations. Cole was pictured on the cover of Time Magazine in 1959 and the Corvair was named the 1960 ""Car of the Year"" by Motor Trends magazine. In 1965, the Corvair was highlighted in Ralph Nader's landmark book ""Unsafe at Any Speed"", which accused General Motors of compromising on consumer safety to develop cheaper and faster cars. Cole publicly refuted Nader's criticisms of the design of the Corvair and the debate led to the creation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a new focus on consumer safety in the industry. , In 1967, Cole was appointed President of General Motors, a position he served in until his retirement in 1974. As president, he oversaw the development of Chevrolet Vega, instituted an increased emphasis on consumer safety and was a pioneer in considering environmental impact of automobiles. In the early 1970s, Cole anticipated the establishment of stronger federal regulations against exhaust emissions. He led GM engineers in developing engines with lower compression rates and introduced the automotive catalytic converter. The design used unleaded gasoline which is significantly less harmful to both humans and the environment than traditional leaded gasoline. The catalytic converter helped reduce exhaust emissions while improving fuel economy and is considered a pivotal automotive engineering development., A prodigious worker, Cole was granted 18 separate patents before his retirement from General Motors in 1974. After retirment, he became Chairman and CEO of the Checkers Motor Corporation, a Kalamazoo, Michigan company that produced taxicabs. Cole was also the Chairman of International Husky, a partnership with Boeing that looked to pioneer the heavy duty air freight industry. In 1977, Cole was killed in a private plane crash over Kalamazoo. He was survived by his wife, Dollie Ann Cole, and five children including his son from his first marriage, David E. Cole, a University of Michigan alumni and chairman of the Center for Automotive Research. , Dollie Ann Cole was born in 1930 in Fort Worth, Texas and attended the University of Texas. She married Ed Cole in 1963. Dollie Cole became well known in the automotive industry for her style and outspoken and vivacious personality which included once calling into the Phil Donahue Show to defend General Motors against criticism from a supporter of Ralph Nader. The production of the first GM cars equipped with airbags was attributed to Cole asking her husband to design a safety solution that would accommodate her fur coats better than lap seatbelts. She took an active interest in the auto industry and in 1972 was the first woman to ride in the pace car at the Indianapolis 500., Dollie Cole was a featured columnist for the Saturday Evening Post and made several appearances on radio and television shows of the day. She was heavily involved in charity work, serving as the Vice Chairman of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, director of National Corvette Museum, a board member of the Public Broadcasting Service and was involved in local Michigan organizations.  After Ed Cole's death in 1977, she moved to the Briarpatch Ranch near Austin, Texas where she was a fixture in local society and continued to be involved in community and charity work. Dollie Ann Cole passed away in 2014. ",

Museum of Anthropology.","Although anthropological specimens had been part of the University Museums' collections since the mid-1800s, it was not until much later that a discipline-specific museum was created for their research and preservation. Prior to the Museum of Anthropology's establishment in 1922, the earliest archaeological acquisitions came to the University Museum from the Wilkes Expedition to the Pacific from 1838 to 1842. Other significant collections were acquired by Joseph Beal Steere during his many trips to the Amazon, the Andes, the south Pacific and Southeast Asia in the 1870s through the 1890s. His expeditions to the Philippines began a long and continuing tradition of research in that area. Steere was also in charge of the university's natural history collections from 1876 to 1894.,  In 1922, Dean C. Worcester, one-time curator of the zoological museum at the university, returned to Ann Arbor from the Philippines to obtain support for an archaeological expedition to investigate Philippine cave sites with Chinese porcelains. Professors Francis Kelsey and Alexander G. Ruthven lent their support and requested that Carl Eugen Guthe lead the expedition with funds contributed anonymously by Horace H. Rackham. Guthe agreed to lead the party, but only if a separate Museum of Anthropology were established to house the material collected.,  Guthe's request was granted; in 1922 the University Museums were reorganized and the Museum of Anthropology was formally recognized. Carl Guthe was made the Associate Director of Anthropology in the University Museum. The collection of porcelains Guthe obtained during the three years of the Philippines expedition became the museum's most valuable single collection. Wilbert Hinsdale, formerly dean of the School of Homeopathy, was made custodian in charge of the Collections in Michigan Archaeology. Guthe's collections were housed in the basement of Angell Hall from 1925 to 1927, while Hinsdale's were located in the Museum Building.,  In 1928, the Museum of Anthropology moved into the fourth floor of the just completed University Museums Building. The museum consisted of five rooms for collections, seven rooms for offices, a library, and an office. In 1929, Guthe was promoted to director of the museum. One of Guthe's many acts as director was to offer a doctoral fellowship in Aboriginal North American Ceramics to James B. Griffin. Griffin began the fellowship in 1933, completed his degree in 1936, then joined the museum staff. In late 1943 Guthe resigned as director of the museum and recommended that Griffin be appointed as his successor. Administrative conflicts stalled the appointment for several years, but Griffin was finally approved by the Regents as the museum's director in 1946. He held this position until his retirement in 1975.,  Upon its establishment, the museum had been arranged into five collection-oriented divisions (also referred to as ranges): the Division of the Great Lakes, the Division of the Orient, the Division of Archaeology, the Division of Ethnology, and the Division of Physical Anthropology. The Division of the Great Lakes dealt with the anthropological resources of the state of Michigan and the areas of other states and Canada that border on the Great Lakes. After Hinsdale died in 1944, Emerson F. Greenman took charge of the Great Lakes Division until 1966.,  The Division of the Orient was devoted to collections from Asia and the Far East. Benjamin March was the division's first curator, followed by Kamer Aga-Oglu. The Division of Archaeology was established for the study of archaeological collections around the world, with particular focus on North America. The Ceramic Repository of the Eastern United States, a central sherd repository for prehistoric ceramic materials from the region east of the Rocky Mountains and north of the Gulf of Mexico, was founded within this division in 1927. James Griffin served as curator of the division until he became director, and was succeeded by Albert Spaulding.,  The Division of Ethnology was established to house ethnological specimens from around the world, with particular focus on North America. Its first curator was Melvin Gilmore, followed by Volney Jones. The Ethnobotanical Laboratory, a center for the identification and interpretation of plant materials utilized by Native Americans, was established within this division in 1938. The Division of Physical Anthropology was originally not provided with a curator and was essentially inactive until 1966, when C. Loring Brace was appointed as curator. From that point on, the division focused primarily on prehistoric skeletal collections from North America.,  The Museum of Anthropology achieved substantial growth during Griffin's long tenure as director. The staff grew from four professional curators to nine, along with additional research associates and assistants. The museum partnered with the Department of Physics in the administration of the Radiocarbon Laboratory from 1949 to 1970; the lab was the second of its kind in the United States. Field programs were greatly expanded, with significant work done in Michigan, the Mississippi Valley, the Southwest, Western and Eastern Europe, and Israel. The museum also took an active role in the university's Department of Anthropology; the museum served as a training ground for most graduate students in archaeology and all curators held academic year appointments in the department, teaching courses and advising numerous doctoral students. Griffin served as chair of the department from 1972 to 1975.,  After Griffin's retirement, Richard I. Ford, Curator of Ethnology, was appointed as director, serving until 1981. From that period to the present, the museum's directorship has rotated among the curators of the museum, who generally serve three- or five-year terms., In February 2014, the Museum was renamed the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology., The geographic focus of the collections has expanded, with additional curatorial positions provided for materials from Europe, Africa and Mesopotamia. The current ranges include Great Lakes Archaeology, North American Archaeology, Asian Archaeology, Ethnology, Physical Anthropology, New World High Civilizations and Old World High Civilizations. The museum currently has twelve curators, in addition to other professional and support staff.,  Today, the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology is one of the major research facilities in the United States for the collection and study of archaeological and ethnological materials.,  (A published history of the museum may be found in The University of Michigan, An Encyclopedic Survey. In addition to the historical materials found in this record group, information on the history and activities of the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology may be found in other record groups held by the Bentley Historical Library, most notably the James B.

Francis taught epidemiology at the School of Public Health and medical school from 1941 to 1969 and greatly influenced the direction of research in his field.,The materials are in English.,"Important certainly for the study of influenza and poliomyelitis research, the Francis papers also document changes in the way scientific research, particularly medical research, was managed. In his correspondence files, the records from his work in combating influenza and poliomyelitis, and his participation in various professional societies, the researcher will find Francis interacting as a member of a scientific community, working with others, soliciting and exchanging views, and administering, when needed, vast programs of testing.,  The Thomas Francis, Jr. papers have been arranged into seven series: General; Correspondence; Poliomyelitis Vaccine Evaluation Center; Organizations; University of Michigan; Speeches, Articles, etc.; Topical Files; and Personal/Biographical. Specific topics covered in the collection are mentioned in the descriptions of individual series. In sum, the collection documents more thoroughly Francis' work since coming to the University of Michigan in 1941. Francis' fame rests upon his research and his heading-up of influenza and poliomyelitis testing programs. For some topics, use of the Francis papers will require of the researcher at least a basic level of knowledge of epidemiology or disease control. Other subjects, such as the administration of research projects and the ways in which information is transmitted within the scientific community are less specialized and capable of being understood by the informed layperson.,  Parts of the Francis papers have not yet been completely processed. Most of these subseries pertain to Francis' organizational commitments and to his membership on various boards and commissions. Types of records in these unprocessed subseries consist of minutes of meetings and procedural records.

Educated at Allegheny College and Yale Medical School, Francis' work centered around the study of the causes of infectious disease, especially pneumonia, influenza, and poliomyelitis, and the development of serum treatments for these diseases.,  The Twentieth Century witnessed a revolution in the manner in which scientific research was accomplished. The solitary figure in an underequipped laboratory gradually gave way to the research team comprised of specialists, established to solve some particular scientific problem, and funded with grants from foundations or agencies of the government. By mid-century, individual discoveries were still being made, but more common was cooperative research, where scientists freely exchanged information and built upon the work of their peers. During the period of Thomas Francis, Jr.'s greatest work, there was now a sense that common life-threatening problems required an all-out team effort and that claims for the discovery were less important than the fact that discovery was made. Leading the way in changing the way epidemiological research was performed was Thomas Francis, Jr.,  Thomas Francis, Jr. was born July 15, 1900 in Gas City, Indiana, the son of Thomas and Elizabeth (Cadogan) Francis. He graduated with a B.S. from Allegheny College in 1921, then received his M.D. from Yale Medical School in 1925. After completing his residency at Yale, he went to the Rockefeller Institute Hospital where he worked in the Clinical Pneumonia Service under Rufus Cole and O.T. Avery. In 1936, he joined the staff of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation where he established study laboratories to work on the etiology and epidemiology of influenza. In 1938, he went to New York University College of Medicine as professor and chairman of the department of bacteriology.,  In 1941, Francis came to the University of Michigan where he served as professor and chairman of the department of epidemiology in the newly established School of Public Health and professor of epidemiology in the Medical School. In 1947, he was appointed Henry Sewell Professor of Epidemiology. Francis remained at the University of Michigan until his death on October 1, 1969.,  Francis' career centered around the study of the causes of infectious disease, especially pneumonia, influenza, and poliomyelitis, and the development of serum treatments for these scourges. While at the Rockefeller Foundation, Francis in his research on pneumonia created what he termed a ""revolution in immunologic theory"" when he demonstrated that antigens that produce antibodies were derived from polysaccharides of the pneumoccus. Prior to then, the accepted belief was that only proteins could function as antigens.,  In 1934, Francis isolated the human influenza virus confirming the work of Smith, Andrewes and Laidlaw in England. He subsequently was able to establish the virus in mice and tissue culture. In 1940, he identified and was able to isolate influenza virus, Type B. The importance of his research was widely recognized. In 1941, he was appointed Director of the Commission on Influenza of the Army Epidemiological Board (its name was later changed to the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board). Here he established ""listening posts"" for the detection of influenza and conducted studies giving evidence that vaccination is effective against the epidemic strains of influenza. First in 1943, he developed a polyvalent vaccine that proved to be highly effective against influenza A in military personnel. Then in 1945, he demonstrated the effectiveness of vaccination against influenza B.,  Throughout the 1940s, Francis and his colleagues undertook numerous studies pertaining to the epidemiology and immunology of poliomyelitis. The purpose of this work was to determine the virus' mode of entrance into a community and its spread thereafter. In 1954, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis selected Francis to head up the Poliomyelitis Vaccine Evaluation Center at the University of Michigan and to test the potency and effectiveness of the inactivated poliommyelitis vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. In what was until then the largest test of its kind, testing 1,800,000 children in forty-four states, Francis demonstrated the vaccine to be safe, potent and effective. On April 12, 1955, with Jonas Salk and Basil O'Connor of the National Foundation by his side, Francis announced to the world that a vaccine for paralytic polio had been found.,  Francis was the author of numerous articles and a book on viral and Rickettsial diseases. He was additionally the recipient of various professional awards. For most of his career Francis was generous with his time, serving on the boards of private research organizations, professional organizations, and national and international governmental committees and institutes. A partial listing only includes the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, the National Academy of Science, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Committee, the Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research, and the Vaccine Development Committee.,  Francis was a significant figure in the development and testing of vaccines to control the spread of two of the twentieth century's most devastating epidemical diseases - influenza and poliomyelitis. Interested in both theoretical and applied studies, Francis devoted his life to understanding the mechanisms of viral infections, and the development of means of resistance and prevention",

The Regents had operated with a series of subcommittees overseeing individual colleges or units. Burton persuaded the regents to focus on broader issues facing the university as a whole. The board reshaped itself with committees on the budget, on salaries, promotion of research, student welfare, educational policies, libraries, and buildings and grounds.,  One result of the restructuring was that the deans, without a designated central committee to report to and work with, were forced to report their needs and plans directly to the president. Burton insisted on hiring an assistant to help with the increased workload. Frank R. Robbins, professor of Greek, was appointed to the post and served under four presidents through 1953.,  The duties of assistant to the president covered a wide range of activities including membership on numerous university committees, overseeing many ceremonial affairs such as commencement, honors convocations, selection of honorary degree recipients.,  With the appointment Erich Walter as Robbins' successor in 1953 the title was changed to Assistant to the President an Secretary of the University.

Fellows and lived there until 1913, when she graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in mathematics. She taught mathematics and physics at the College of the City of Detroit, now Wayne State University. In 1916, she married R. Louis Gomon, a University of Michigan engineering graduate. They had five children, including Bobby Lou (Mrs. Frederick Dewey); William; Howard Garner, who was killed in World War II; Jeanne (Mrs. Guy Nunn); and R. Louis, Jr. While raising her family, Mrs. Gomon taught throughout the Detroit public school system, wrote a child education column for The Detroit News, and worked for the local Planned Parenthood league.,  In the 1920s, Mrs. Gomon met Clarence Darrow, and their friendship continued throughout the Ossian Sweet trial in Detroit and up until the time of his death. The Recorders Court Judge who presided over that trial was Frank Murphy, who was also a graduate of the University of Michigan. In 1930, Mrs. Gomon worked on Murphy's campaign for mayor of Detroit and upon his election to that office became his executive secretary and chaired the Mayor's Unemployment Committee.,  When Murphy went to the Philippines in 1933, Mrs. Gomon was appointed the director of the newly established Detroit Housing Commission by Acting Mayor John Smith. Brewster and Parkside Houses were built during her term in office. She left that position in 1938, and worked in private business until 1941, when she was appointed by Harry Bennett of the Ford Motor Company as Director of Women Personnel at the newly constructed Willow Run bomber plant. In this capacity she fought for industrial safety, day care centers, and helped in the planning and construction of war workers' housing. In 1929, 1935, and 1941, Mrs. Gomon ran for elective office in the city of Detroit, the first election for the Board of Education and the other two for Common Council. Although she met defeat in every campaign, she received substantial electoral support throughout the city and was one of the first women to run for public office in Detroit.,  From 1945 to 1948, she conducted a radio program on WKMH called ""Opinion Unlimited."" In 1948, her husband, R. Louis Gomon, died. Until her death in 1975, Mrs. Gomon participated in campaigns for social welfare and human rights through her memberships in the Americans for Democratic Action, NAACP, and the American Civil Liberties Union.,  In 1960, she was honored at a tribute dinner which was attended by nearly every well-known political and governmental figures in the state of Michigan. A year later, Wayne State University gave Mrs. Gomon an honorary degree commemorating her long years of service to the city and the state.,  In her later years, Mrs. Gomon attempted to write two major works. The first was a biography of Frank Murphy. The second project dealt with Henry Ford and Harry Bennett.",

But in the Philippines, because he was a provincial governor and head of the indigenous military force, Bandholtz was at the center of affairs in this period of Philippine history. And beyond that, he made an effort to maintain and preserve as much documentation from his service here as he could.,  The Bandholtz papers came to the library in three separate accessions in 1965, 1994 and 2005.

He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1890, and then for the next thirty-three years he served his country in more than a dozen different assignments and posts. Bandholtz early demonstrated his competence as an officer with leadership abilities, and he was continuously rewarded with a steady series of promotions to different challenging assignments. He was a front-line officer, a teacher of the military arts, an administrator within the military hierarchy, and a skilled and respected diplomat.,  Following some early assignments, Bandholtz in 1896 was selected to teach military science and tactics at Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University). He was a teacher for two years when, with the outbreak of war with Spain in 1898, he returned to active duty. In Cuba he served in the Santiago campaign with the 7th U.S. Infantry, receiving a Silver Star citation for his participation. Between 1898 and 1900, he held different positions in the United States and Cuba. In July 1900, he left Cuba for the Philippine Islands where he served for the next thirteen years. Bandholtz' first responsibility was to help establish peace in the Islands which was then being disturbed by various local insurgent armies, notably in Central Luzon and on the Island of Marinduque and in Tayabas Province.,  Bandholtz quickly earned the respect of the Philippine people. In 1902, he was elected governor of Tayabas Province, the only regular army officer to be elected to so high a position. In 1903, he was appointed assistant chief of Philippine Constabulary with the temporary rank of colonel and placed in command of the District of Southern Luzon. Bandholtz was an effective commander who arranged for the unconditional surrender of insurgent general Simeon Ola and his forces in Albay. In 1905, he was transferred to the District of Central Luzon where he similarly apprehended Philippine bandit leaders. In 1907, he was appointed chief of Philippine Constabulary with the temporary rank of brigadier general. He held this position until relieved on September 1, 1913.,  Upon returning to the United States, Bandholtz was put in command of Fort Porter at Buffalo, New York (1914-1915) and a battalion of the 30th Infantry at Plattsburg Barracks, N.Y. (1915-1916). With this command, he served on the Mexican border for six months in 1916. During World War I, Bandholtz served on the Western Front, receiving promotion to brigadier general with command of the 58th Infantry Brigade of the 29th Division. In September 1918, General Pershing appointed Bandholtz to be provost marshal general of the American Expeditionary Forces where his duties included reorganizing the military police corps and managing the guarding of German prisoners of war.,  From August 1919 to February 1920, Bandholtz served as American representative on the Interallied Military Mission sent to Hungary by the Supreme Council to control the unauthorized Rumanian occupation of that country. Bandholtz later served as the first United States Commissioner to Hungary. He returned to the United States in 1920, receiving promotion to permanent brigadier general with command of the 13th Infantry Brigade at Camps Funston and Meade. In August 1921, Bandholtz was assigned the duty of organizing and commanding the newly authorized District of Washington. Shortly thereafter, he was sent to West Virginia when the state authorities requested federal aid in maintaining the peace during a strike of coal miners. Bandholtz retired from military service in 1923 with the rank of major general. He died in his hometown of Constantine, May 7, 1925.",

Office of Strategic Services., University of Michigan. Dept. of Political Science., University of Michigan -- Faculty.","Joseph Ralston Hayden was born on September 24, 1887 in Quincy, Illinois. He received his B.S. from Knox College in 1910, then his M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1911 and 1915 respectively. From 1910 to 1912, while a student, Hayden was an assistant in American history at the University of Michigan. In 1912, he became a member of the university's department of political science, where he remained, except for his service with the government, until his death on May 19, 1945.,  During World War I, Hayden was a lieutenant in the Michigan Naval Militia serving as senior officer of the University of Michigan division. He was in active service from April 1917 to February 1919. Following the war, Hayden returned to the University of Michigan.,  Hayden was a recognized authority on the Philippine Islands. In this, Hayden was carrying on a tradition begun by Dean C. Worcester, who, like Hayden, was both on the faculty of the University of Michigan and called to public service in the Philippine Islands because of his expertise and experience. In 1922-23, Hayden was an exchange professor at the University of the Philippines; in 1930-31, he was the Carnegie Visiting Professor in the State University of the Philippines. In 1922-23, 1926, and 1930-31, Hayden was special correspondent in the far east for the Christian Science Monitor. Hayden used each of these opportunities to travel in the islands, to study, and to make contacts with Philippine citizens, both government officials and private citizens.,  In recognition of his learning and wide experience in Philippine matters, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Hayden to serve as vice governor of the Philippines and secretary of public instruction. His choice for governor general, Frank Murphy, though possessing administrative skills and political charm, was coming to the Philippines without any real knowledge of the actualities of Filipino life and custom, and thus Roosevelt's reasoning for pairing Hayden with the former Detroit mayor. Hayden responded admirably to his selection by the president, performing his duties efficiently, even serving as acting governor general when Murphy returned to the United States for a six-month period.,  With the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, Hayden returned to the University of Michigan, where he taught and worked on what would be his classic work, The Philippines: A study in national development (1941). Following his return, Hayden was named James Orin Murfin Professor of Political Science and chairman of the department.,  Hayden returned to public service with the outbreak of World War II, where his knowledge of the Philippines proved invaluable. From 1941 to 1945, he worked with the U.S. Office of the Coordinator of Information and, after June 1942, with its successor organization, the Office of Strategic Services. From 1943 to 1945, Hayden was named civil adviser and consultant on Philippine affairs with the U.S. War Department, attached to the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. As part of this latter activity, Hayden developed and headed up as chief a special staff section of the United States Armed Forces for the Far East - the Philippine Research and Information Section. The role he envisioned for the Philippine Research and Information Section was three-fold: to prepare reports and studies about the Philippines; to distribute information about the Philippines as needed; and to collect books, magazines, newspapers, and printed and manuscript materials about the Philippines with a view to their ""effectiveness in furthering the prosecution of the war.""",

Thomas Yoder began to pray with this group in January 1968 and he quickly became an active member of the community. Yoder was very concerned with preserving the history of the group, and became the unofficial historian of the organization.,  As time passed, Yoder became increasingly critical of the community's leadership. Eventually, this disagreement with the leadership, and his attempts to carry the dispute outside of the community itself, led to an understanding between Yoder and the leadership that he should terminate his public commitment to the organization. This occurred in November 1976.",

From a founding group of 19 members, within 20 years the church grew to a membership of 350 through active evangelism in the surrounding southeast Grand Rapids neighborhood. The church was, and continues to be, a bastion of Baptist fundamentalism.,  In 1909 Rev. Oliver W. Van Osdel was installed as Wealthy Street's eighth pastor. Under his direction a major building campaign took place; the church was designed to be a neighborhood gathering place, and had the appearance of a school or community center rather than a traditional church. The new building opened in 1917, the same year that Van Osdel led Wealthy Street and 13 other churches away from the ""modernist"" local Baptist Association to form the fundamentalist Grand River Valley Baptist Association. Wealthy Street took on a key role nationally among fundamentalists as well, first with the Baptist Bible Union [BBU], and later with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches [GARBC].,  Saving souls and promoting the Bible as the unerring Word of God have always been at the heart of Wealthy Street's mission. At its high point in 1954, the church had 1,717 members and supported 38 missionaries around the world. In addition to Sunday schools, church groups and a neighborhood visitor program, Wealthy Street also started the Children's Bible Hour radio program in 1942; the Michigan Christian Home for the elderly in 1959; and its evening Bible institute, which began in 1941, grew into the Grand Rapids Baptist College and Seminary.,  Rev. Van Osdel retired from the pulpit in 1934, and was succeeded by Rev. David Otis Fuller, who was Wealthy Street's pastor for the next 40 years. Fuller was a man of strong fundamentalist convictions, widely known for his uncompromising beliefs and fiery sermons.,  By the early 1970s, church membership was declining, due partly to an aging congregation, and also to changes in the surrounding neighborhood, as many Wealthy Street parishioners moved out to the suburbs. The decision to move out of the city was controversial, but in 1988 the church moved into a new $2.5 million complex in suburban Grand Rapids, and changed its name to Wealthy Park Baptist Church. By the early 1990s the church was supporting 50 missionaries, and had 825 members.",

He was educated at the City College of New York (BA 1928), Yale University (MD 1932), and Johns Hopkins University (MPH, 1938).,  His career began in 1936 with the Maryland State Health Department, Bureau of Child Hygiene. He spent a year, 1941-1942, at the School of Tropical Health in San Juan, Puerto Rico and then worked at the New York City Health Department while teaching part time at Johns Hopkins University, Columbia, and Cornell. In 1946 he took the position of professor and head of Pediatrics for Louisiana State University Medical School. From 1952 to 1960, Wegman held several positions in the World Health Organization (WHO), including chief of education and training, secretary-general, and consultant to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).,  When Wegman became Dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health in 1960, he was a well-established figure in the field of public health and a respected specialist in child health care. Wegman's work reflects a concern for the best possible health care for the greatest number of people, a position which was cause for worry for many administrators and medical care professionals because it implied a substantial financial commitment and institutional restructuring. While at the University of Michigan, Wegman served on the Commission on the Reduction of Excess Hospital Capacity. Here he was given the difficult task of targeting hospitals for bed reduction. Dr. Wegman also headed the push to implement HMOs at the university, a proposal vigorously resisted by administrators.,  Dr. Wegman served on numerous committees and boards, often assisting with project implementation. He was one of the developers of Project HEADSTART. He helped to develop three health planning organizations; he was President of the Comprehensive Health Planning Council of Southeastern Michigan and member of the Michigan State Public Health Advisory Council. He was active in the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Board of Preventative Medicine, and the American Medical Association among other health organizations. His annual reports on world infant mortality in the journal Pediatrics from 1950 to 1997, gave him international repute as an authority on child health.,  Among the many honors he received during his career were: the Sedgwick Medal, the highest award of the American Public Health Association, Man of the Year from the City College of New York, the Clifford G. Grulee Medal from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Bronfman Prize from the American Public Health Association. On his eightieth birthday, the Myron E.

His family was large and exceptionally close and from an early age, as the oldest living child, he participated in the family businesses. He attended school until he was twelve, but received most of his literary education at home. As a teenager he passed Michigan's school teachers' examination and taught in a one room school for a year. In 1894, he went to seek a law degree at Northern Indiana Normal School at Valparaiso, Indiana (now Valparaiso University), and in two years was admitted to the Indiana bar although he was underage. In 1896, he began the study of law at the University of Michigan which he completed in 1898. In 1899, he and his wife Beth Garwick Lacy settled in Clare, Michigan, where he set up his law practice.,  In 1902, he was elected to his first of four terms as mayor. Retiring from that office in 1906, he later sought the office of prosecuting attorney, for which he was defeated. In 1909, he accepted an invitation from Alfred Lucking, Henry Ford's lawyer, to practice law in Detroit. Governor Woodbridge Ferris, with whom he had corresponded since childhood, appointed Lacy judge of the new Detroit Domestic Relations Court in 1913. Lacy under-took initial organization of the court, which had jurisdiction over divorce and family cases. The court was dissolved eight months later in 1914, by the Michigan Supreme Court and Lacy again entered private practice in the law firm of Anderson, Rackham, and Wilcox, replacing the retiring Horace Rackham.,  In 1920, he was appointed head of the Detroit Civil Service Commission by Mayor James Couzens, whose private attorney he was until Couzen's death. In 1923-1928, he represented Couzens in the Ford Stock Tax Case, and was instrumental in the settlement of the case in favor of the stockholders. Lacy also wrote for Couzens the instrument of Trust setting up the Children's Fund of Michigan. In 1930, Lacy began a personal campaign to reduce heavy taxes during the depression, which he thought could be done by decreasing the cost of government. In 1932 and 1933, he assisted thirty small Michigan banks in avoiding panic and remaining solvent. He was also deeply involved in the Detroit bank crisis of 1933 and co-author of the Michigan Emergency Banking Act. These public involvements catapulted him into prominence in the Democratic party.,  In 1934, Lacy was mentioned as a candidate for U.S. Senator. But only after great persuasion did he enter the Democratic gubernatorial primary to challenge successfully the current governor William A. Comstock. In the November election, he ran against Republican Frank Fitzgerald, but was defeated. Lacy's political decline was apparently rapid. He devoted his time to his legal practice and philanthropic activities that included the Salvation Army, the Boys' Club of Detroit, and the Youth Services of the Knights Templar, Grand Commandery of Detroit. He also began to diverge politically from Franklin D. Roosevelt, recoiling from deficit spending, the welfare state, attempted court packing, and Roosevelt's intention to run for a third term. Lacy, however, was never welcomed as a statesman in the Republican party.,  In 1947, Lacy retired from active participation in his law firm and cut back his legal work. He remained involved in income tax cases, a field in which he was considered an expert. Most of his public activities were connected with philanthropy, although he served on the National Sanitation Foundation and on the Board of Directors of the Parker Rust Proof Company. He died in 1975.",Lacy family.
130,umich-bhl-91460,"Pontiac, Michigan family. Biographical information; letters exchanged between Harry Crawford and his family and friends relating to his experiences in the Spanish-American War and World War I; memorabilia; and photographs.",The material is in English,"The Crawford family collection documents the experiences of Harry M. Crawford as a soldier during the Spanish-American War and World War I. It also contains information about the home front in Pontiac, Michigan during those two wars. There are few accounts of battles in these letters; rather the strength of the collection lies in the abundant descriptions of daily life both in the army and in Pontiac during this time period.,  The correspondence, which is the heart of this collection, is chronologically arranged and divided into Spanish-American War correspondence (1898) and World War I correspondence (1917-1919). The Spanish-American War correspondence is further divided into correspondence from Harry Crawford to his family in Pontiac and correspondence from family and friends to Harry Crawford. Harry Crawford's letters to his family began in May 1898 when he mustered in at Camp Eaton, west of Pontiac. Crawford continued to write home, on a near-daily basis, from army camps in and around Tampa, Florida. The letters end in September when he returned to Michigan. Most of Harry Crawford's letters pertain to the daily routines of army life during encampment and rumors about the progress of the war. While Harry Crawford was generally supportive of United States war aims, he was critical of the capture of the Philippines (see his letter of August 10). The correspondence from family and friends to Harry Crawford contains information on a wide range of daily activities in Pontiac at the turn of the century. Reactions to the war were supportive on the home front (see especially the letters of G.G. McDonald from July 4 and of George Crawford from July 31). Advice on the art of soldiering from Harry's uncle, Walter Crawford (a Civil War veteran), may be found in a letter dated July 3.,  The World War I correspondence is almost exclusively from Harry Crawford. Few letters from home survived but some information about Pontiac during the war, such as the impact of the influenza and the lack of coal during the winter, may be gleaned from Harry's responses to letters from his family. Harry Crawford's letters began in August 1917 from Fort Sheridan in Illinois. They continued through 1918, from France, and concluded in April 1919 when he returned to the United States. Harry Crawford wrote, on average, two to three letters per week. While Crawford spent some time on the front lines, descriptions of actual battles are few. Many of the letters describe the camaraderie with fellow soldiers and several tell of his anticipation of combat. A number of other letters pertain to the material conditions of his daily life (food, lodgings, and clothing). He also described the destruction wrought on the French countryside. Since his letters were censored, Crawford omitted references to specific places in his letters. Some of this specific information is included in a letter to his brother, George Crawford, following the Armistice (see his letter of November 24, 1918).","World War, 1914-1918., Spanish-American War, 1898., World War, 1914-1918.","Photographs., Postcards.",Pontiac (Mich.),"Crawford, Harry M., Crawford, Harry M.",,"In May 1898, Harry Crawford of Pontiac, Michigan enlisted in the 32nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry to fight in the Spanish-American War. After a brief period of basic training at Camp Eaton, near Island Lake, Crawford traveled to Florida where his company awaited orders to join the fighting. Because of the speed of the American victory in Cuba, those orders never came. Crawford returned to Pontiac in September of 1889 and mustered out of the army.,  In August 1917, Harry Crawford enlisted in the army again. Following officer's training at Fort Sheridan, near Chicago, Crawford was commissioned as a second lieutenant. In January 1918, Crawford's unit was shipped to France. He spent much of the spring stationed at various camps behind the front lines. Crawford, like many other officers, was frequently billeted in French villages and he witnessed many aspects of everyday French life. In July and August, Crawford saw combat on the Ypres front. By this time, his division, the 118th Infantry, had been placed under British command. Made up mostly of South Carolina men, this unit fought throughout the rest of the war in the British, rather than the American, theater of operations. In October, he was sent to a special school organized by the British army in France to learn advanced infantry techniques. By November 1, Crawford was back with his unit and was in combat again just before the end of the war. He experienced minor injuries resulting from a poison gas attack but recovered shortly after the Armistice. In December 1918 and during the winter of 1919, Crawford traveled widely around France before being shipped back to the United States in April 1919.",Crawford family.

Morton J.'s parents had come to the Philippines in 1911 to teach in the public schools as part of the Tomasites teacher corps. Morton J. completed his primary and secondary education in Manila (Philippines) and, in 1931, took undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of the Philippines Manila (Proposal, Box 5). , Morton J. Netzorg arrived in the United States in 1940. There he met Hannelore ""Floh"" Fuld (1923-2008), a Jewish emigrant from Berlin, Germany. Hannelore subsequently changed her name to Petra and was known as Petra or Pete for the rest of her life. Morton J. and Petra married in 1941 and had two children, Susan and David., In the 1950s the Netzorgs settled in Detroit, Michigan, and opened the Cellar Book Shop, which specialized in material published in and about the Southeast Asia region--the Philippines and the Pacific Islands in particular, as well as East Asia, South Asia, and Africa. Their business became the essential source of material dedicated to these regions in North America. Morton J. acquired warehouses of books, maps, and other Filipiniana material, and shipped them to Detroit. He built the largest collection of Philippine children's book and textbooks. , Morton J. himself became one of the most important bibliographers of the Philippines. He published extensively in Kinaadman (Wisdom), a journal published in the Philippines, as well as other scholarly journals. He also authored a number of important Filipiniana bibliographies and bibliographical essays, notably about children's literature and about the World War II period in the Philippines, as well as memoirs.

(George Edward), 1887-1965., Carton, John J. (John Jay), 1856-1934., Stevens, Frederic B.","Michigan. Supreme Court., Scottish Rite (Masonic Order), Freemasons.","George Edward Bushnell was born November 4, 1887 in Roanoke, Virginia. After graduating from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1907, and working for a time as an advertising executive, Bushnell studied law in Cincinnati, then came to Detroit in 1913 where he enrolled in the Detroit College of Law. He graduated in 1915, and was admitted first to the Bar of Virginia and later to the Michigan Bar.,  Bushnell saw brief service during World War I as a trial judge advocate. Upon the war's conclusion, he returned home to Michigan where he became a partner in a Detroit law firm. In 1933, he ran for public office as the Democratic candidate for the Michigan Supreme Court. He was re-elected for two additional terms in 1941 and 1949.,  During the late 1930s and throughout the 1940s, Bushnell gained further prominence as a national mediator in industrial disputes. He was referee for the National Railroad Adjustment Board (first appointed in 1939). He was later appointed by President Truman to the National Railway Labor Panel in 1946. That same year, Bushnell chaired the Presidential Fact Finding Board on the matter of the airline pilots' strike. At war's end, President Truman asked Bushnell to serve as one of the judges of the Nuremberg war trials, but because of his heavy schedule on the state Supreme Court he declined the offer.,  Throughout his life, Bushnell seemed most committed to, and took most pride in, his activities as a Freemason. Because so much of the Bushnell papers concern Freemasonry, it might be helpful to outline something of the organization of Scottish Rite Masonry.,  An individual enters Masonry through Blue Lodges, where he is able to obtain three symbolic degrees: the first degree being ""Entered Apprentice,"" second degree, ""Fellowcraft,"" and the third degree, ""Master Mason."" Beyond Master Mason, the individual has the option of pursuing two branches of Freemasonry, York Rite and Scottish Rite. York Rite consists of Royal Arch Masons, Royal and Select Masters, and Knights Templar. Scottish Rite, the branch which Bushnell entered, includes the degrees from the fourth to the thirty-third. The administrative units for the Scottish Rite are called Valleys. Within the Valleys, there are four divisions: 1) the Lodge of Perfection, covering the fourth to fourteenth degrees (its presiding officer is the Thrice Potent Master); 2) the Council of Princes of Jerusalem, covering the fifteenth and sixteenth degrees (the presiding officer is the Sovereign Prince); 3) the Chapter of Rose Croix, covering the seventeenth and eighteenth degrees (presiding officer is Most Wise Master); and 4) the Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret, covering the nineteenth through the thirty-second degrees (its presiding officer is the Commander-in-Chief).,  The governing body for the several Valleys in the Northern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite is the Supreme Council, whose members are chosen from among the Valleys. From the Supreme Council in turn, there are chosen a smaller number of ""Active"" members who act as a kind of board of directors for the Supreme Council. There are at least two ""Active"" members in each state, one of whom is designated as the ""Deputy"" for that state. Heading the Supreme Council is the Sovereign Grand Commander, followed by a Lieutenant Commander and by the Grand Minister of State.,  The governing body within each state is the Council of Deliberation, which is headed by that state's Deputy, and who in this role is designated as the Council's Commander-in-Chief.,  With this background in mind, the researcher will better understand the multiplicity of roles which Bushnell played in Scottish Rite Freemasonry. He was ""Raised"" a master mason in Taylor Lodge No. 23 in Salem, Virginia in the early 1900s. Later, upon moving to Detroit, he entered Scottish Rite Freemasonry through the Valley of Detroit. He quickly moved up the Masonic ladder, becoming Thrice Potent Master of the Detroit Lodge of Perfection in 1925, and later Commander-in-Chief and Trustee of the Detroit Consistory, as well as a Trustee of the Masonic Temple Association.,  During this time, in 1924, he was chosen Honorary Member of the Supreme Council and served as Sovereign Grand Inspector General, 33¬∞. In 1934, he was crowned an ""Active"" member of the Supreme Council. Two years later, by virtue of his status as an Active member he was chosen Deputy for Michigan and Commander-in-Chief of that state's Council of Deliberation. In 1945, he was selected as Grand Lieutenant Commander of the Supreme Council of the Northern Jurisdiction; and in 1954, he assumed the position of Sovereign Grand Commander upon the retirement of Melvin Johnson. It was at this time that Bushnell decided to devote all of his energy to the Scottish Rite, and thus retired from the Michigan Supreme Court in 1955 before the completion of his third term. Bushnell served full-time as Grand Commander until his death in 1965.,  As a Mason, Bushnell traveled widely and undertook a variety of responsibilities. In 1945, he journeyed to Europe as member of the joint White House Masonic Service Association mission. Among the many committees on which he served were the committees on Jurisprudence; Fraternal Relations; Constitution and Laws; and Rituals and Ritualistic Matters. Beyond fraternity, Bushnell's special interest in the Masons was its support of mental health research, especially in the area of schizophrenia. During his term as commander, Bushnell significantly strengthened this program through support of the Benevolent Foundation.,  Outside of the Masons, Bushnell's other interests included involvement in the Michigan Democratic Party, the American Bible Society, the Michigan Board of Education, and the Sons of the American Revolution.",

His parents, William Millhouse Steere and Elizabeth Cleghorn Steere (nee Beal), were of pioneer Quaker stock. Both had brief careers as teachers before they married and turned to farming. In 1848 the Steere family moved by railroad and canal to Covington, Kentucky, on account of the father's poor health. In 1849 they moved again, to a spot twelve miles from Cincinnati.,  After the entire family recovered from a bout with typhoid the next year, the Steeres returned to Michigan by wagon. In 1851, when Joseph was nine years old, he was sent to live with his uncle, to work to earn his keep.,  In 1853 the Steeres moved to the ""Miner Settlement"" in Bloomer Center, Montcalm County. Steere recalled that school became important to him at this time. He had always enjoyed reading, but now he began to push himself to excel.,  In 1858 Dr. George Pray, one of the earliest graduates from the University of Michigan, moved to a farm not far from the Steere home. Pray made a generous offer to prepare any interested student for college. Joseph Steere took up his offer, and he began to study with Dr. Pray on a weekly basis.,  Steere was nineteen when the Civil War broke out. He wanted to enlist, but he was unable to, in part because of his father's opposition. So he remained at home and studied and taught school.,  During the Civil War Steere moved to Ann Arbor, where he lived with Dr. Pray. Believing that he needed further formal education, Steere obtained permission to attend Ann Arbor High School. While two of his brothers did ultimately fight for the Union, Steere's enthusiasm to participate was tempered by his desire to receive an education. He never did enlist.,  While in Ann Arbor, Steere became acquainted with the town's first botanist, Miss Mary Clark, who ran a girls' school. Steere had been interested in the workings of the natural world since childhood, but it is possible that his friendship with Miss Clark was instrumental in directing him toward a career in natural history.,  After Steere was graduated from high school, he worked on his father's farm until he passed the University of Michigan entrance exam. He began his college education in September, 1864. Although he had become interested in natural history, he entered the University of Michigan Law School in 1868. He earned his degree two years later.,  He did not practice law. Instead he embarked on an extensive world tour to gather collections for the University of Michigan Museum. His mother's cousin, Rice A. Beal--owner and publisher of the Ann Arbor Courier--agreed to pay for the expedition if Steere would write letters from his journey to be published in the Courier. Steere's travels lasted more than four years, taking him across the Andes (by horse and by foot) into Peru, and then east to China, Formosa (Taiwan), the Philippines, the Malaccas, and the Dutch Moluccas.,  Steere shipped home thousands of specimens of birds, reptiles, mammals, and plants. On the Island of Marajo he excavated huge prehistoric burial mounds. He obtained rare manuscripts from Formosa, and he studied fifteen previously unknown tribes along the Amazon. He was especially interested in native dialects, and he compiled phonetic studies of several different languages.,  His work in the Philippines was particularly notable. Many of the islands he visited had never been scientifically studied. He added at least sixty species of birds to the known Philippine avifauna, and he did extensive work on the distribution of animals throughout the archipelago.,  In 1875, when Steere reached Singapore, he received word that he had received the University of Michigan's first honorary doctorate, in recognition of his scientific achievements. At the same time he was made an Assistant Professor.,  The following year the Regents appointed Steere Assistant Professor of Paleontology and Curator of the Museum to which he had donated his collection. This was the first such museum to be built on the campus of a state university, and, consequently, a large variety of contributions began to pour into the new museum, including the Chinese collection that had been exhibited at the World's Industrial Fair, 1884-1885, in New Orleans. (In April of 1876, shortly after assuming his new responsibilities at the University of Michigan, Steere had spent some time in the British Museum collecting and perfecting data for his own collections.),  In 1879 Steere became a full Professor of Zoology and Paleontology. During that year he returned to the Amazon with a party of male university students. In the space of three months they collected over a thousand specimens of birds, mammals, reptiles, and fish.,  In 1887 Steere requested a year's leave of absence, and again leading a party of five younger men, he returned to the Philippines. Three years later he went back to the Amazon, this time under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. He studied the Hypurinas, Jamadi, and Paumari Indians.,  Steere resigned from the University in 1894. He had been asked to resign by the Regents, possibly, as he maintained, because his outspoken stance on temperance had angered the local German community.,  After retiring, Steere spent the rest of his life on his farm near Ypsilanti. In 1901, however, he was again in the Amazon region, collecting for the Smithsonian's exhibition for the International Exposition in Buffalo. He continued to take an interest in scientific trends, and he carried on correspondence with his former colleagues and with people working for Prohibition.,  Steere was an intensely religious man. He was active in the Methodist Sunday School and in the temperance movement. He sided with the Darwinists in the great nineteenth century debate over evolution versus creationism, but he was a strong proponent of what he called ""argument from design."" He believed that the natural world provided ample proof of the existence of a Designer, for he felt that life was too meticulously formed and intricately linked to be merely the result of fortuitous and random accidents.,  Steere's later writings reflect his thoughts on religion, philosophy, and evolution. He began an autobiography when he was 89 years old, a work that showed a fine memory for detail, particularly details from his childhood years. He wrote some verse and numerous moralistic children's stories--many of them with animals living in authentic woodland settings.,  Steere married Helen Buzzard on September 30, 1879. Before their marriage she had been the principal of the first ward school of Ann Arbor. The couple had five daughters and four sons.,  Steere died on December 7, 1940. He was ninety-eight years old. Accolades for his lifetime accomplishments came from, among others, the University of Michigan, from the community of natural sciences, and from the Philippine National Council.","Beal family., Buzzard family."

In 1918, he enrolled in Ripon College under the auspices of the Student Army Training Corps. Following his graduation in 1923, he entered McCormick Theological Seminary. While studying in seminary he was director of boy's work at Howell House, a mission outreach to the foreign-born living on the southwest side of Chicago. He received his ordination in 1926, and was appointed director of the Gary, Indiana Neighborhood House. It was while working in Gary that he met and married Maurine Fink, his companion for the next 58 years.,  In 1930, the couple was called to New York by the Presbyterian Board of National Missions to work for the office of City, Immigrant, and Industrial Work. From New York they were called to direct the Dodge Neighborhood House in Detroit, Michigan. They arrived in the midst of the depression and the struggle to organize the United Automobile Workers. It was during their stay in Detroit that their two children David and Sandra were born.,  After thirteen years in Detroit, the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions invited the Jones family to China in 1947. Working with the Church of Christ in China Henry became a pioneer in the field of industrial mission. As the communists rose to power Jones sent his wife and two children home in 1948. He remained in China until 1950.,  Back in the United States, Reverend Jones served pastorates in the Dubuque, Iowa Presbytery between 1950 and 1953. In late 1953, Jones was recalled to the mission field. Originally assigned to India, visa complications caused him to go to Japan instead. It was during this time in Japan that the first Asian Conference on Industrial Evangelism was held in Manila. The conference included representatives from sixteen Asian countries.,  Jones's first stint in Japan ended in 1957. While awaiting recall he served as a worldwide traveling consultant before returning to Japan in 1962. After three years the Joneses retired from foreign mission. During his ""retirement"" Jones served as interim pastor in nine different Michigan churches. In 1985 he made his retirement official at the age of 85.,  In their later years, the Joneses maintained contact with many Asian acquaintances, even returning to China to visit in 1979. They were also instrumental in bringing several students from Asia to study in the United States. In 1981 Henry Jones was honored with the G.R.A.C.E. (Grand Rapids Area Center For Ecumenism) award. McCormick Seminary similarly honored him in 1985, for his lifetime commitment to mission.,  In addition to his years of devoted service to his Church, the Rev. Jones was also interested in the experiences of the Welsh in America. He was particularly concerned with the history of Welsh churches and religious song festivals in Michigan.",

When his father, Karl, accepted a faculty position in the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan later that year, Guthe's family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he grew up. Guthe received his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1914. He received two degrees in anthropology from Harvard University, an M.A. in 1915 and a Ph.D. in 1917.,  As a graduate student and after receiving his degrees Guthe participated in archaeological fieldwork in Pecos and Guatemala. In 1922 he was hired by the University of Michigan to lead an expedition to the Philippines to locate Chinese porcelains and bring them back for the university's collections. Guthe accepted the position with the condition that the university establish a Museum of Anthropology within the University Museums to house the collections. His condition was met, and Guthe was named the associate director of the museum that same year. He was named director of the Museum of Anthropology in 1929, and given the additional title of director of the University Museums in 1936.,  Guthe was instrumental in the development of both museum and academic programs in anthropology at the university. As a museum administrator, he oversaw the development and expansion of the Museum of Anthropology in its formative years, including the establishment of the Ceramic Repository for the Eastern United States and the Ethnobotanical Laboratory. As a faculty member, he founded the Department of Anthropology with Julian Steward in 1929, and taught some of the first formal courses in anthropology and archaeology at the university. He also developed and organized the first courses in museum science in 1938.,  Guthe was an influential force outside the University of Michigan as well. He was the principal founder of the Society for American Archaeology, and wrote the original constitution and bylaws. He also served as the organization's first secretary-treasurer, from 1935 to 1940, and as its president from 1945 to 1946. He was chairman of the Division of Psychology and Anthropology of the National Research Council from 1938 to 1941. He held leadership positions in a number of professional organizations, including terms as president of the Central States Branch of the American Anthropological Association from 1928 to 1929, and as president of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts and Letters from 1939 to 1940.,  Guthe left the University of Michigan in 1944 to become director of the New York State Museum and State Science Service. He held that position until his retirement in 1953. After his retirement, he served as a research associate for the American Association of Museums, for whom he conducted a national survey of museums.,  Guthe and his wife, Grace, had three sons, Karl, Alfred (also an anthropologist), and James.

Palmer was born in Connecticut, June 5, 1807. He moved to Lenox, New York in 1810. He was educated at Hamilton College. In October 1836, he came to Michigan and taught in Clinton, Michigan. Although he was a teacher, he also acquired 160 acres of government land to farm. He became active in the local community and when Bridgewater Township was first organized, Palmer became one of its officers and would hold the office of township clerk for thirty-six years, twenty-nine of them being consecutive.

He was house surgeon at the University for two years and assistant to Dr. J. M. Marden for one year. He then established himself in Brooklyn, Michigan in private practice. With the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Palmer, in May 1898, enlisted in the Thirty-third Michigan Regiment as hospital steward. He went to Cuba with his regiment and after the battle of Aguadores assisted in dressing wounds. He was then stationed at the hospital of Siboney until August, when he was sent to Fortress Monroe, in charge of the first boatload of wounded. Two weeks after landing he was called to Washington and discharged from the Thirty-third regiment by order of the Secretary of War. Surgeon General Sternberg then appointed him acting assistant surgeon to report to Camp Alger. Soon he was transferred to Camp Meade, and then to Summerville, South Carolina, where he remained until April, 1899, when he resigned and returned to his home. On Sept. 9, 1899, he received a telegram from Surgeon-General Sternberg, asking him to go to the Philippines as acting assistant surgeon. He telegraphed his acceptance, and three days later set sail for the Philippines. He arrived at his destination on Nov. 5, and on the 9th was assigned duty at the Santa Mesa hospital, where he remained with the exception of one month, during which time he was lecturer in the hospital of instruction at Manila.

For three decades, he was Michigan's best-known public servant, a consummate politician, known and respected by thousands. Murphy was born April 13, 1890 in Sand Beach (later Harbor Beach), Michigan. He graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1914, served in the infantry during World War I, and upon his discharge received appointment as first assistant United States attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.,  Although a holder of high political office, Murphy kept coming back to the law. In 1923, he was elected Detroit Recorder's Court judge. Here, he won national attention with his one-man grand jury probe into various departments and as presiding judge in the famous Sweet trial. In 1930, following the removal by recall of Charles W. Bowles, Murphy was elected mayor of the city of Detroit. He was reelected in 1931 and served until May 1933. As mayor during the heart of the depression, Murphy won high marks for his efforts to deal with the devastation caused by widespread unemployment.,  A staunch supporter of Franklin Roosevelt in his presidential campaign of 1932, Murphy was rewarded with appointment as governor-general of the Philippines. He served in this position until the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth in November 1935 at which time he became the United States high commissioner. At President Roosevelt's urging, he returned to the United States in 1936 to run for governor of Michigan. In that Democratic year, Murphy won handily. His term as governor was marked by the Flint sit-down strike and his efforts to bring New Deal reforms to Michigan government.,  In 1939, Roosevelt appointed Murphy to serve as attorney general of the United States. He distinguished himself as a crusader against crime and corruption. The attorney general was primarily responsible for establishing a civil liberties unit within the Justice Department. Murphy served as head of the Justice Department until January 1940 when he was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. For nine years, often in the role of a dissenter, Murphy championed the cause of civil liberties.,  Following difficulties with his heart, Frank Murphy died July 19, 1949.",Murphy family.

The first service was held on February 7 at the YMCA in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The Church then moved to a rented storefront under the name of the Lovett Street Church of God a few weeks later. Reverend John Batdorf served as the first pastor. The first set of bylaws was adopted at a special congregational meeting on May 26, 1938.,  In 1941, the congregation started meeting at the Faith Memorial Church with Rev. Batdorf serving as the main minister and the congregation of Faith Memorial providing the building. After sixteen months the congregation decided to rent space again, this time at the Eastside Community House.,  1945 was an important year for Eastwood's congregation. The Reverend Weldon Lane became pastor of Eastwood and a building committee was elected. The building committee initiated the first Christmas dinner to raise money for the building fund. The Christmas dinner has become an important tradition with the congregation ever since. With funds from the Christmas dinner and other sources the congregation was able to purchase a house on 2929 East Main Street at Sunnyside Drive in Kalamazoo. The house was used for worship until a sanctuary was built. The sanctuary at the new property was dedicated in November 1946 and served as the congregation's home until 1991.,  On August 22, 1948, Reverend B. Gale Hetrich and Bessie Hetrick assumed the pastorate at Eastwood. ""Accents,"" the church newsletter was first published on March 26, 1950. Also in 1950 the church was able to provide a parsonage at 1233 Upland Dr.,  Reverend Maurice Mauch became the third pastor at Eastwood in June 1956. In 1960, ground was broken for a major expansion of the church. The new sanctuary, dedicated April 9, 1961, seats 350 and also included modern teaching facilities able to accommodate 450 students.,  In 1964 Reverend Harold Minkler assumed pastoral duties at Eastwood. During Reverend Minkler's tenure the congregation expanded with 180 individuals attending services regularly in 1969, the largest attendance in Eastwood's history. Since its first days music has played an integral part of Eastwood's religious life. An adult and children's choir has existed since the early years of the church. In the 1960s, church musical programs expanded with for example a youth choir created in 1964, the dedication of a new organ in the same year, and the presentation of the first octave of hand bells in 1965. Eastwood has added more hand bells to its musical program and it has become an important component in worship and concert.,  The pastorate was undertaken by Reverend L. Spencer Spaulding in 1976. In 1978 Eastwood elected its first associate pastor, San Germany. The new pastor's responsibilities were music (choir director) and community outreach. In 1979, Dick Forsman was designated the first associate minister of youth.,  Reverend Brian Hansen began pastoral duties in 1980. In 1984, a remodeling created two new Sunday school classrooms and a youth meeting space. Another remodeling in 1987 created new office facilities and a small fellowship hall. The sanctuary library and narthex were also renovated.,  Eastwood Church of God has always been involved in the support of missionaries. The Ladies Missionary Society was founded in 1937. In 1972, the society disbanded and a mission outreach committee was formed. In 1964, Eastwood joined the Living Link program in support of Church of God missions. During the 1980s, many members of the congregation participated in work camps in Guyana and the Philippines.,  Reverend John Henbruch, who took over pastoral duties in 1987, has had the responsibility of leading a church in flux. By 1987, regular attendance had decreased from a high of 180 to an average of 80 people on Sunday mornings. A special association meeting was called on April 9, 1989. The issue was to decide what direction the church should take in the future. Eastwood was feeling the pressure of a changing neighborhood. The outcome of the meeting was to focus targeting efforts on new members from the suburbs, which might necessitate changing the location of the worship center. The Eastwood Church of God sold its property in 1991, and moved to a rented building in a suburban location.",

The far-reaching scope of these papers derives from Theodore H. and Grace Griffin Hubbell's diligent collecting of family papers and photographs. The bulk of the early materials are Hussey family papers consisting of the personal papers of Grace's mother, Lenora Hussey Griffin, and her mother's nuclear family. This family consisted of Lenora's parents, John Milton and Mary C. Hussey, and her siblings, William J., Edgar P., Arthur, and Alice, and their spouses.,  The Theodore H. Hubbell papers should be viewed as a subset of a larger universe of collections which include the Hussey family and Hubbell family collections here at the Bentley Historical Library and the John Milton Hussey letters and diary at the University of Michigan's William Clements Library. The strengths of this collection are diverse, ranging from a rich run of Civil War correspondence between John Milton and Mary C. Hussey, to Lenora Hussey Griffin's letters to her family about her education at Stanford, to Theodore Hubbell and J. Speed Rogers correspondence with various entomologists regarding field work and collecting. The collection will be of use to researchers interested in nineteenth-century agriculture, the Grange in Ohio, family life and customs, Joseph B. Steere's expedition to the Philippine Islands, and visual images of turn of the century Michigan and the University of Michigan. The collection is weak on documenting Theodore Hubbell's work as a teacher and curator of the Museum of Zoology; these records are retained by the museum for use in administering their collections.,  The Theodore H. Hubbell papers span the years 1833-1988, with the bulk of materials covering the years 1852-1970; they are organized into five series: Genealogy, Hussey Family, Hubbell Family, Personal, and Professional. The first three series reflect Theodore and Grace Griffin Hubbell's efforts as genealogist/archivist for their respective families. The Personal series primarily deals with the private lives of Theodore and Grace Hubbell, but it also contains some materials linked to the first three series in the correspondence with Lenora Hussey Griffin. The materials in the first four series were rearranged during the course of processing to facilitate access to the Hussey and Hubbell family papers. The last series consists of Theodore Hubbell's professional correspondence (including letters to his cousin Roland F. Hussey) and project related materials; this series retains its original order.","Agriculture -- United States., Entomology., Women -- Michigan -- Ann Arbor., Dwellings., World War, 1914-1918.","Albums., Photographs., Postcards.","Ohio., Ohio -- Social life and customs., Philippines -- History -- 1898-1946., United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865., Benzonia (Mich.), Beulah (Mich.), Fort Sill (Okla.), Frankfort (Mich.), Milford (Mich.), Philippines -- History -- 1898-1946.","Hubbell, Theodore Huntington, 1897-1989., Hubbell, Theodore Huntington, 1897-1989., Hubbell, Clarence, 1870-1950., Hubbell, Grace Griffin., Hubbell, Winifred., Hussey, John Milton., Hussey, Mary C., Hussey, Roland F., Hussey, William Joseph, 1862-1926., Rogers, J.

Even after his ostensible retirement, Hubbell came to the museum daily and served as ""everybody's mentor"" until his death in 1989. Hubbell's professional reputation rested on his enduring interest in and extensive writings on Orthoptera, and his local reputation rested on the organizational skills he demonstrated in the administration of space and resources within the museum. Theodore was born in Detroit in 1897 to Clarence (Detroit's Civil Engineer) and Winifred Hubbell. The family spent the years 1907 to 1913 in the Philippine Islands where Clarence worked as civil engineer for Manila and where Theodore first developed his interests in natural history and entomology. The younger Hubbell earned two degrees from the University of Michigan: his B.A. in 1920 and his Ph.D. in 1934, working in the interim as a professor of entomology in Gainesville at the University of Florida.,  In one sense Hubbell never left Ann Arbor for, as he continued his doctoral research, he was building up the collection of Orthoptera in the Museum of Zoology. This continuing relationship was doubtless encouraged by Hubbell's mentor, Alexander Ruthven, and by the construction of a new museums building in which to house the burgeoning collections. While in Florida, Hubbell did not stray far from his Michigan roots intellectually as he joined a staff anchored by J. Speed Rogers, another student of Ruthven. Both men took to heart Ruthven's teaching that a systematic understanding of zoology, one that linked historical geography and habitats to the distribution and evolution of insects, was the most rational natural philosophy. This close relationship between environment and fauna was a hallmark of University of Michigan zoologists and may be seen as laying the groundwork for the ecological sciences. Both Rogers and Hubbell returned to the University of Michigan in 1946, Rogers as director of the Museum of Zoology, Hubbell as curator of insects at the museum and professor of entomology.,  Rogers' and Hubbell's impact on the museum was immediate and beneficial as they reorganized the extensive holdings of the insects to make them more accessible to the appropriate researchers. They each brought their own considerable area of expertise to play on the museum's holdings of craneflies and grasshoppers. With the unexpected death of Rogers in 1955, Hubbell assumed more obvious control of the administrative aspects of the museum. Under his direction, existing programs of teaching and research were broadened, ties with the zoology department were strengthened, systematic biology came to prominence in the curriculum, and a research wing was added to the museum with monies from the National Science Foundation. Hubbell was instrumental in the formation of the inter-university Organization for Tropical Studies, played a significant role in expanding the study of biological systematics in a number of contexts, and advised the National Science Foundation on facilities and programs most needful to zoological museums. In recognition of his accomplishments and service the University conferred a distinguished faculty achievement award upon Hubbell.,  Theodore Hubbell married Grace Griffin in Ann Arbor in June 1927. By so doing, Hubbell linked himself to a family with further ties to the University of Michigan. Grace's uncle, William J. Hussey, was professor of astronomy at the university in 1891-1892 and from 1915 until his death in 1926; William's wife, Ethel Fountain Hussey, was a distinguished alumna whose philanthropy is commemorated by an eponymous room in the Michigan League. Grace's cousin, Roland F. Hussey, taught Ornithology in 1918 and returned (at the behest of Theodore Hubbell) as visiting zoologist specializing in Hemiptera during the 1950s. Another cousin, Russell C. Hussey, was professor of geology during the 1920s and served as assistant to the dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts during the 1930s. Theodore and Grace had three children, Roger, Mary Joan, and Stephen.","Hubbell family., Hussey family."

During this period Dr. Reed held many positions, including Professor of Municipal Government at the University of California, Berkeley, Executive Secretary to the Governor of California, City Manager of San Jose, California, Consultant for the National Municipal League, Director of the National Municipal League's Consultant Services, and privately employed municipal consultant. In his role as municipal consultant, Reed studied the administration and organization of many American cities, including Atlanta, Augusta, Charleston, S.C., Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Norfolk, Richmond, and Hartford, Connecticut.,  Dr. Reed was an active member of the American Political Science Association and he maintained a strong interest in Belgium during much of his life. He published a study of Belgian government in 1924, assisted in the translation of Leopold of the Belgians (1929), participated in the activities of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, and was an officer in the Order of Leopold.,  Thomas Harrison Reed was born in Boston in 1881. He was educated at Harvard University where he received his AB in 1901 and his LL.B. in 1904. He did post-graduate work at Columbia University in 1908 and 1909 and received an LL. D. from the University of Brussels in 1930. Dr. Reed was a Professor of Political Science at The University of Michigan from 1922 until 1936 when he resigned to devote his full attention to his duties as Director of Consultant Services for the National Municipal League, a position which he held since 1933. Dr. Reed served as Director of Studies for the Republican Program Committee during 1938 and 1939 and thereafter he was a privately employed municipal consultant. Throughout his career, Reed maintained a close association with the National Municipal League and was active in the League's affairs. Reed also held positions on many councils and commissions involved with the study of government in many communities. During his lifetime, Reed was often in contact with such luminaries of the American intellectual establishment as Charles A. Beard, A. Lawrence Lowell, and Charles E. Merriam. Dr. Reed was an accomplished public speaker and a prolific author of books and articles on a variety of topics relating to government. He died in Wethersfield, Connecticut in 1971.",

The library holds over seven million volumes and a wide variety of cartographic, audiovisual, manuscript, microform, and digital materials., (Please note that some of the libraries at the University of Michigan are not part of the University Library system. These include the Law Library, the Kresge Business Administration Library, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, the Clements Library, and the Bentley Historical Library. Individual findings aids for the record groups of most of these libraries can be found at the Bentley Library.), The Library has long played a central role in the development of the University. The Act of 1837, which provided for the organization of the university, included a provision stating that a portion of student fees would go toward increasing the library. The Board of Regents elected Reverend Henry Colclazer to serve as librarian. A year later, in September 1838, the Regents passed a resolution authorizing Asa Gray, Professor of Botany and Zoology, to purchase the materials to serve as the basis for the library's collection while on a tour of Europe, and appropriated $5000 for this purpose. While in London, Gray commissioned George Palmer Putnam to select most of the materials, developing a collection of 3,401 volumes covering the subjects of history, philosophy, literature, science, the arts, and law. The complete list of titles was printed as a state document in 1841. The Library is unusual in that, unlike most academic libraries, it was established through a major purchase rather than a gift.,  In November 1841, the Regents approved the Regulations for the Library which included that the library would be open once a week, no books be loaned to students without faculty approval, that fines were to be paid for overdue books, and that no more than two volumes could be borrowed at a time. Initially housed in the home of one of the university's professors, the books were moved to the third floor of the Main Building in December 1841., In 1854, President Henry Tappan initiated a subscription drive among Ann Arbor residents to raise funds for acquisitions and called for an annual appropriation from the Regents. These acts brought a steady infusion of money to ensure ongoing collection development. After years of having a succession of faculty members serve annual terms as the librarian, Tappan's son, John L. Tappan, was appointed as full-time librarian in 1856, and effectively became the first Librarian of the University., As the Library's collections grew, it outgrew the space afforded it. After a series of shared homes, including spaces in the North University Building and the Law Building, the state legislature appropriated $100,000 for the library to have its own purpose-built building (1881). Opened in 1883 and located in the center of campus, the library consisted of a large reading room attached to cruciform stacks. When the library outgrew that space and several additions, the university secured over $350,000 from the legislature for a new building to be designed by Albert Kahn (1915). The existing library was demolished, and a new General Library building opened in 1920. Several divisional libraries, including collections devoted to rare books, natural science, chemical engineering, education, and museums were also established during this time period. Some of these collections were housed within the General Library while others were hosted out of academic departments or other buildings on campus., Over the years the directors of the University Library made a number of important contributions to the development of the library and the larger field of library and information science. Andrew Ten Brook (1864 - 1877) introduced the library's first card catalog, with handwritten author and subject cards for both books and periodical articles. Raymond C. Davis (1877 - 1905) directed increased collection development and oversaw the opening of the first General Library building. Theodore W. Koch (1905 -1915) developed the library's first reference collection and instituted a library orientation program. William Warner Bishop (1915 - 1941), nationally recognized as one of the country's leading librarians, presided over the establishment of the Library Extension Service, the opening of the new General Library in 1920, the development of substantial divisional and specialized collections, and a number of cataloging innovations, in addition to leading the university's first Department of Library Science and serving terms as the presidents of the American Library Association (ALA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA).,  In the 1950s and 1960s, the way in which the library provided services to the academic community evolved. Whereas once the General Library had served as the major research center for all academic subjects on campus, as the university's academic programs expanded and the need for collections to support those programs grew, the General Library's role came to be seen more as providing support solely for the humanities and social sciences. Specialized divisional libraries and libraries that provided services targeted to particular groups of patrons began to grow to support all other subjects. Rather than conceiving of them as small collections that supplemented the General Library, the library began developing larger and more self-contained divisional libraries, including the Physics-Astronomy Library, the first divisional library to be purpose-built rather than housed in a building designed for other purposes. As the network of campus libraries grew larger, the entire system came to be known as the University Library system., The most important new library built in this time period was the Undergraduate Library, which opened in 1958. Designed to house a select collection of standard works commonly consulted by undergraduate students, the Undergraduate Library was the first large open-stack library on campus, though many of the divisional libraries already had open stacks. The Undergraduate Library differed from other libraries on campus in that it contained space for students to read, listen to recordings, and meet with others, as well as reference services specifically geared to undergraduate students. Open stacks were subsequently introduced in the General Library. These innovations led to increased library use and circulation on campus.,  A seven-level addition to the General Library was constructed in 1970. The new addition nearly doubled the General Library's capacity, and provided added space for users and staff. While originally only the South Building was to be given a new name, soon after its opening the entire complex housing the North and South Buildings came to be called the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. New divisional libraries were also constructed in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably the Taubman Medical Library in 1979., In the 1970s, the University Library system began a program of automated cataloging through the Michigan Library Consortium. Automation became fully integrated into library operations in August 1988, when the library's online catalog MIRLYN (Michigan Research Library Network) was introduced. The retrospective conversion of card catalog data was funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and included over 10 million bibliographic records, covering 99% of the library's collections.,  The University Library continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most significant developments during the decade was the establishment of the library's Digital Library Services in 1993, which develops and maintains digital resources to support research and instruction and provides technology management services for the University Library system. Another important accomplishment was the library's participation in the campus-wide initiative led by President James Duderstadt to design the Media Union on North Campus. Opened in 1996, the Media Union houses the Art and Architecture and Engineering Libraries, and hosts and provides services for an extensive array of innovative digital tools and resources. Under the leadership of Paul Courant (University Librarian from 2007-2013), the University Library expanded its digital collections through its participation in the Google digitization project (an ambitious initiative to digitize all the books in the library) and the creation of HathiTrust Shared Digital Repository.,  The University Library continues to be one of the leading research libraries in the world, with innovative programs in digital library services, access, and reference, and nearly unparalleled depth and breadth of collections.

Reighard attended the public schools at LaPorte, Indiana, entered the Literary Department of the University of Michigan in the fall of 1878, and graduated with the Ph.D degree in 1882. Following his graduation he taught for three years in Indiana and Massachusetts. During the last two years of this period he was a private student of Dr. E.L. Mark of Harvard University. After this he spent a year at Michigan in the study of medicine.,  He began his teaching career at Michigan in 1886 when he was appointed Instructor in Zoology. During the absence of Professor Joseph B. Steere he served as Acting Assistant Professor, 1887-88, and was made Assistant Professor of Zoology in 1889. Jacob Reighard was directly responsible for many changes in the character of zoology courses. To the old group of courses dealing with the systematics and natural history of various animal groups, he added Vertebrate Dissections, Histology of Vertebrates, Elements of Biology (Animal Life), and Embryology, each of which required laboratory work as well as the usual lectures or recitations. Beginning in 1889 the zoological courses were listed in two groups in the catalogue, ""General Zoology"" Systematic taught by Professor Steere, and Animal Morphology given by Professor Reighard. In 1892 Professor Reighard was made Professor of Animal Morphology; his department was separated from the old department and was known as the Morphological Laboratory.,  Professor Reighard spent the year 1894-95 in study at the University of Freiburg, Germany. After his return in 1895 his title was changed to Professor of Zoology and Director of the Zoological Laboratory and the Museum of Zoology. The museum position he retained until 1913. He continued as Director of the Zoological Laboratory until 1925 when he relinquished the active directorship, retaining his professorship until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1927. In 1936, after the close of his active career, the University of Michigan conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Science.,  With Professor Frederick C. Newcombe and Dr. George P. Burns of the Department of Botany, Professor Reighard was a cofounder of the University of Michigan Biological Station on Douglas Lake in Cheboygan County in 1909 and was its first Director. Professor Reighard's contribution to the development of the research function of the Museum of Zoology during his directorship, 1895-1913, was stated thus by his successor: ""During this time the museum was made up of a number of collections under the direction of the heads of several teaching departments. It is largely due to Professor Reighard that the Museum of Zoology did not become an adjunct to a teaching department but was an independent research department of the University. Professor Reighard directed the scientific work of the Michigan Fish Commission for the years 1890-1895 during which time a number of important research projects were carried through to completion. Although for lack of support this series of investigations came to a close in 1895, the present Institute for Fisheries Research of the Michigan Department of Conservation probably should be considered to be ""the delayed outgrowth of the scientific work which he did for the Michigan Fish Commission"" some decades earlier.,  In 1898-1901, professor Reighard was in charge of the Biological Survey of the Great Lakes conducted by the U.S. Fish Commission, and for some years beginning in 1917 he directed important researches on the food fishes of the Great Lakes. As an outgrowth of the latter and possibly indirectly as the result of his own earlier work on the Great Lakes came the establishment in Ann Arbor of the Great Lakes Laboratory of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).,  Professor Reighard held membership and served as officer in various scientific organizations including A.A.A.S. (vice president of Section F, 1910), American Society of Naturalists, American Society of Zoologists (vice president of the eastern branch and president of the central branch in 1903), the Ecological Society of America, American Fisheries Society (president, 1915), and the Michigan Academy of Science (president, 1900). He presided at two sessions on Animal Behavior at the International Zoological Congress at Boston in 1907. For some years he served as trustee and member of the Executive Committee of the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, and was a member of the Board of Scientific Advisers of the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey.,  Professor Reighard was always interested in the improvement of methods and in the application of new methods to zoological research. An expert photographer, he described methods of photographing embryos, of photographing breeding fishes in their natural habitats, and of photographing coral-reef fishes by means of a submerged camera which he devised. His book on the ""Anatomy of the Cat"" written with H.S. Jennings has had extensive use in anatomical laboratories and was revised by Dr. Rush Elliott in the 1930's with the collaboration of Professor Reighard.,  In the later years of his active career, increasing deafness caused Reighard to learn speech reading. His interest in helping the deaf community led him to translate a number of German papers on this subject and to prepare several original papers, some of which are still in manuscript form. This work and the completion of manuscripts on breeding habits of fishes occupied much of his time after his retirement.,  Jacob Reighard was responsible for the development of modern zoological teaching and research at the University of Michigan. Through his teaching, his researches and his leadership in zoological organizations he exerted a marked influence upon zoology in the United States. Reighard died February 13, 1942 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
